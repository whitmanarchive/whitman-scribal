            <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, asking his opinion as to the correctness of the decision of the Treasury Department in the case of Edward P. Wilson; and to say in reply that it is his duty to render opinions upon questions of law only when propounded by the President, or the Head of one of the Executive Departments. I am instructed to say, however, that he has recently given several opinions upon questions of bounty, which he will be happy to show you, if you will call at this office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your ob't servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chief Clerk.</span>
