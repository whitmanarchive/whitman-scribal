            <span class="tei_ab">January 3, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. B. F. Potts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Governor of Montana,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Virginia City.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 1st ultimo, relative to the case, which you say is before the Supreme Court of The United States, involving the title to the offices of Territorial Auditor and Treasurer of Montana, was duly received and replied to by the Attorney General—and I now have to acknowledge the receipt of another letter from you, upon the same subject, bearing date the 22d ultimo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon an examination of the 
            
            
            
            
            
            docket of the Supreme Court, it does not appear that the case referred to by you has been entered.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It may be that the right of appeal has been lost, owing to the case not having been docketed prior to the expiration of the first six days of the time,—but if you will cause a transcript of the record of the Court below to be transmitted to this Department, I will take such action in the premises as may be necessary.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">and Acting Attorney General.</span>
