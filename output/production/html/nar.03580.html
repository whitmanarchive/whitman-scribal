            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 23, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. C. Delano,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Interior.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receit of your letter of the 9th of September enclosing a copy of one addressed to me on the 3d of September, 1870, by the Hon. J. D. Cox, then Secretary of the Interior, in reference to transactions of John D. Wright, who had been appointed by the Department of the Interior as agent of certain Indians, and requesting my attention to the subject of Mr. Cox's letter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Soon after that letter was received, the matter which it presented received a careful consideration in this Department, and I was under the impression that the result had been communicated to the Department of the Interior. Learning by your letter that such was not the case, I immediately submitted the matter to the Solicitor General for examination and report.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>His conclusions are stated in his letter to me of the 21st instant, which I herewith transmit.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I concur in his judgment.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If you desire that suit shall be brought against Mr. Wright, and his sureties, I will direct the District Attorney to proceed accordingly, and put himself, for information as to the facts, in communication with such officers of your Department as you may desire.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman, Attorney General.</span>
