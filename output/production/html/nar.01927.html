            <span class="tei_ab">June 23, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Wm A. Richardson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22d inst., with accompanying papers, all relating to the case of George T. Risinger, arising under the Internal Revenue laws.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The terms of compromise recommended by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, are, that "the case be dismissed, the claimant paying 'all costs,' as proposed, including twenty dollars, District Attorney's fee." I assent to the recommendation of the Commissioner—but I respectfully suggest this single modification,—that whatever fee is legally due the District Attorney in the case, to be taxed in the usual manner, be paid, whether this fee be greater or less than twenty dollars.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
