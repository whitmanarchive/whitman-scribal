            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have examined the petition of Sophia E., Alexander, and Amelia C. Robinson, of Cook Co., Ill., which you were pleased to refer to this office on the 4th inst.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The petitioners represent that they are the heirs of Alexander Robinson, deceased, an Indian reservee under the Treaty of July 29, 1829, (7 Stat. 321,) according to the provisions whereof the lands to which they have succeeded cannot be alienated without the permission of the President; and the object of their application is to obtain such permission to make a conveyance of part of the property in trust to secure a loan to them of $1000, which they desire to employ in building.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I perceive no objection to the scheme proposed, and recommend that permission be granted in accordance with the request—which may be done by merely signing your name under the endorsement written on the back of the petition.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
