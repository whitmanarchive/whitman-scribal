            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 2, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Capt. Charles Bentzoni,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">25th U. S. Infantry,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Fort Bliss, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am advised by the War Department that suit has been brought against you by one Walker for acts understood to have been done in the line of your official duty.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have written to the District Attorney for the Western District of Texas, C. T. Garland, Esq. of Jefferson, directing him to correspond with you, and to undertake your defense, unless you are already provided with counsel. From one expression in your letter to the Adjutant General, I am disposed to think that you have already employed counsel. If you have done so, and I find it practicable under the law, I will make arrangements for recognizing and compensating him. In order to this, it is necessary that I should know the facts, and the terms of the employment, and whether he can take the oath required of District Attorneys. Will you be kind enough to give me information on the subject?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
