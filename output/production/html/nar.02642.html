            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 4, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Roger M. Sherman, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Knoxville, Tenn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter from Knoxville of the 29th ultimo, has been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">My letter of the 28th ultimo, addressed to you at Knoxville, in the case of Mr. Camp, answers some of the matters in your last. I repeat that you seem to understand your Commission as requiring a much larger expenditure than was in my contemplation when you were sent out; and, while all expenditures absolutely necessary within the scope of your original Commission will be allowed, you will be careful to confine yourself to the objects and expenditures then contemplated.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is impossible for me at this distance to determine upon the propriety of particular minor expenses.
            
            
            
            
            Something must be left to your judgement, and this you will exercise to accomplish the object for which you were sent, at the least possible cost.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You have twice referred in your letters to a particular fund. You should not act with the expectation of expending a single dollar of that fund. It is exhausted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
