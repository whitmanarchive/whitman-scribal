            <span class="tei_ab">August 14, 1865.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I beg to say, in returning the papers in the matter of the claim of Mansfield &amp; Co. of Memphis, Tenn. that I would much prefer that you would lay before me a statement of the facts on which the questions of law therein presented may be supposed to arise.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have looked sufficiently into the case to enable me to see that I ought not to give any opinion on it, until you advise me that I may assume that a certain state of facts is the one on which the questions you present arise.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">One question of fact I do not see at all alluded to in the papers, viz: whether the money claimed is or is not in the Treasury of the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">James Speed</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
