            <span class="tei_ab">March 17, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">To Isaiah M. Morris</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">and Thomas S. Samson, Esqs.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sirs:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of this date, inquiring whether I will review a case in which an Opinion was rendered by Attorney Gen'l Black, the same being the case in which Mrs. Harriet E. Parker, widow of William E. Parker, is interested. I suppose that the opinion to which you refer was given in response to a call from the Secretary of State, and is found in Volume 9 of Opinions of Attorneys General, p. 364.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have no right to review, and undertake to set aside the opinion of any former Attorney General. If called upon either by the President, or the Head of a Department for advice in matter of law connected with their official duties, it is my duty to give such advice, and in so doing I should be bound to pay due respect to the opinion of former Attorneys General upon the same, or a similar question. Without such a call, I cannot consider the matter which you present.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
