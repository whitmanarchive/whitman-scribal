            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 28, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. C. A. Tweed,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Associate Justice,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Prescott, Arizona.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 26th ultimo from San Francisco, asking leave of absence from your Territory from the adjournment of your Court in January next until the middle of April, has been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I sympathize with you in the domestic afflictions which you have suffered, and feel authorized to accord, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nunc</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pro</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">tunc</span> a leave of absence for your late visit to California. But under the order of the President of the 30th of March last I do not feel at liberty to authorize the leave for which you ask next winter and spring.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your late absences from the Territory however excusable, make it peculiarly important that your time should henceforth be generally spent with the people to whom you administer the law. If a Judge's domestic exigencies do not permit him to spend his time in his Territory, he ought not to retain the office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
