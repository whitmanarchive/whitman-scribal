            <span class="tei_ab">December 17, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Clerk of U. S. Circuit Court,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Richmond, Va.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letters respectively of the 8th and 13th instants, asking that you be allowed to incur the expense of investigating the claim of the United States against Wm. H. Barry, late clerk of the U. S. Circuit Court for the District of Virginia, have been received. The Attorney General, previous to his leaving Washington, requested me to consider and reply to them.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is not the custom of this Department to assume the expense in cases of this kind. The Court itself, in view of the relations sustained to it by Mr. Barry, has the power to issue summary process for the investigation of his alleged defalcation.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The attention of the District Attorney will be called to the matter, and directions will be given him to take such action as the interests of the United States shall require.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">and Acting Attorney General.</span>
