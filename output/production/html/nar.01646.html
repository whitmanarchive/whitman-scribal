           <span class="tei_ab">January 17, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received the following papers, which I now enclose to you:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">1. An application from Mr. George Taylor, of Atlanta, Georgia, to the President, for a commission as Paymaster in the Army of the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">2. A recommendation from Major Allison, the Paymaster now serving on Gen. Terry's staff.</span>
            
             
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">3. A letter to myself from the father-in-law of Mr. Taylor, the Hon. H. K. McCay, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Georgia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have no personal knowledge of Mr. Taylor. Gentlemen in whom I have confidence recommended him to me highly.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Judge McCay is one of the ablest and most prominent Republicans of Georgia, and there are few, if any, of the citizens of that State whose wishes in such a matter are deserving greater consideration. His letter admits that at present the existing vacancy could not be filled, but is written under an expectation that the present restrictions will soon be removed by Congress.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In view of the very small representation of the Southern States in such offices, I think it very advisable that such an application as Mr. Taylor's should be granted, if there be an opportunity—and if he is personally worthy,— of which latter fact I entertain no doubt.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
