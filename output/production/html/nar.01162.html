            <span class="tei_ab">January 18, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I return the papers which you handed me this morning. The questions which the Committee on Military affairs of the House of Representatives wish you to submit to the Attorney General for his opinion, have, as I think, already been submitted to this Department, and an opinion upon them given by the Hon. O. H. Browning, my predecessor in office. That opinion was transmitted to the Hon. J. M. Schofield, Secretary of War, under date of June 16, 1868, and is undoubtedly on file in your Department. A copy of it would probably answer the purpose of the Committee.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not suppose that it has
            
            
            
            
            been usual, or is proper, to submit a second time to the Attorney General questions upon which an opinion has once been given.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
