            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. P. E. Brocchus,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Associate Justice, New Mexico,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Baltimore, Md.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I had supposed that long before this you had terminated your absence, without leave, from the territory of New Mexico, by a return thither, as you informed me was your intention when you called upon me here. I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from the Hon. C. P. Clever, Delegate from the Territory, who informs me that you are still here, and that ill consequences are suffered from your absence. I shall be willing to receive any explanation of this prolonged absence that you may have to make to me.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. yours, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
