            <span class="tei_ab">December 6, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. W. W. Belknap,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to transmit herewith a communication from the U. S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina, accompanying which are also the copies of papers therein mentioned concerning certain Land situated near Florence, S. C., taken by The United States for the purposes of a national cemetery, under the provisions of the Act of Feb. 22, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In compliance with the recommendation contained in your letter of the 18th of July, 1870, the said Attorney was, on the 9th of Sept. last, instructed by this Department to take proper steps, in behalf of the The United States, to obtain an order from the U. S. District Court, for the District aforesaid, setting aside the appraisement of the premises theretofore had, which was regarded as manifestly excessive and unjust, and directing a new appraisement to be made.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">An order to that effect having afterwards been obtained from the Court, it appears that the owner has since proposed, by way of compromise, to take $450 for the land, the Government paying costs of court; and in view of this proposal the District Attorney desires further instructions as to the course he shall pursue under the circumstances.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As instructions in this matter should properly emanate from your
                
                
              
            
            
            Department in the first instance, the papers enclosed are referred to you for your information, with the assurance that I shall take pleasure in communicating to the District Attorney such directions respecting the subject of his letter as you may deem it expedient to give.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Please return the papers herewith when they are no longer needed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Sir, with great respect, &amp;c,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
