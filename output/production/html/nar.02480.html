            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 9th instant, and, in reply, have to inform you
                that, in view of the facts therein stated as to the cause which prompts you again to
                ask leave of absence, the previous action of the Department declining such leave is
                reconsidered, and permission is granted you to be absent from the Territory for a
                period not exceeding three weeks, at the end of which time you will be expected to
                return to your post.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Owing to the great complaint made on account of the absence of Judges from their
                Districts, and in view of the Executive order, a copy of which is enclosed, all
                applications from them for leaves of absence, unless based upon the most urgent
                necessities, must be declined.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
