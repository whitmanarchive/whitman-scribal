            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. W. Douglas,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Act'g Com'r Internal Revenue.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of to-day, asking the return to the Office of Internal Revenue of the papers in the Internal Revenue case of Joseph S. Finch &amp; Co., with the action of the Attorney General thereon.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">These papers were sent to this office by the Secretary of the Treasury, accompanying his letter of the 28th of February last, with the request for an opinion on the question
                
            
            
            of law stated in that letter, and the question is still under consideration by the Attorney General. As the papers came from your office originally, I send them to you enclosed herewith,—but I do not understand the request of the Secretary of the Treasury for an opinion to be withdrawn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Act'g Attorney Gen'l.</span>
