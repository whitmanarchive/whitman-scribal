            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. John Cummins,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Boise City, Idaho Terr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and to say in reply, that Hon. R. T. Miller was confirmed by the Senate as your successor. He has been informed from Judge Miller that he intends to qualify, and under these circumstances he does not consider it necessary to entertain the question of a leave of absence to be granted from this office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants, Chief Clerk.</span>
