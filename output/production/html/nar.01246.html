           <span class="tei_ab">March 7, 1870.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I enclose herewith a certificate of A. B. Maynard, Esq., U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, with two bills attached, one of François Carom, Esq. Police Magistrate of Windsor, Canada, for $15, Canada currency, and one of Samuel S. Macdonald, Esq. county crown attorney, of Essex county, in the province of Ontario, Dominion of Canada, for $10, both relating to services rendered in the attempted extradition of one Thomas Barr. The letter of Mr. Maynard to me enclosing these papers states that Thomas Barr was in jail in the city of Detroit, in June, 1869, awaiting trial in the District Court of the United States on the charge of passing counterfeit money—that he escaped from jail, and fled to Canada—that the U. S. Attorney sent his assistant to Windsor, Canada, to institute proceedings for his extradition—that two examinations were had there, when Barr consented to return to Michigan—and that he did return, was arraigned, and pleaded guilty—and is now in prison, serving out his sentence.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am of opinion that the amounts charged in the bills enclosed are reasonable and I send them to the Department of State, that if there is any appropriation for paying for services of this character, these bills may receive your consideration.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very resp. your ob't servt,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar, Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">(enc.)</span>
