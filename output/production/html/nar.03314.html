            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 5, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. W. W. Belknap,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a letter to you from Gen. Howard, of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, reporting the discontinuance of a prosecution against one Willis <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">et</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">al</span>. in Louisiana, for falsely personating one Brown, a soldier to whom bounty money was due—and requesting my views as to the legality and soundness of the action taken by the District Attorney.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">According to the Report of the case it seems to me that the offence of Willis <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">et</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">al</span> was criminal under Section 18 of the crimes Act, of March 5, 1825, (8 U.S. Stat. 120,) and I have so informed the District Attorney. But as the Report is not very full, I have addressed that officer calling for a full report of the case, and of the grounds upon which he discontinued the prosecution. When his answer shall have been received I will give you a more deliberate opinion of the matter than at present I am able to form.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
