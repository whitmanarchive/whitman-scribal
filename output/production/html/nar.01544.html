           <span class="tei_ab">December 14, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry R. Jackson, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Savannah, Geo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received yours of the 8th instant, in relation to the claim of Titus as informer, for a moiety of the proceeds of the Macon Laboratory property, etc.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Last April, under instructions from the Attorney General, I, as District Attorney for Georgia, moved to vacate the order adjudging him to be informer, and entitled to one-half of the proceeds. I learn that afterwards application was made to the Attorney General (Mr. Hoar,) to authorize the withdrawal of that motion. This he declined to do, and it would hardly be becoming in me, under the circumstances, to reverse my predecessor's official action. It seems to me, therefore, to be the best course to let the decision be made by the Court. I informed
                
                
              
            
            
            Mr. Titus last summer that this course would be taken, and also stated to him the reasons for it.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not understand the matter as you do. I suppose the controversy to be between Titus and the Government, and not between Titus, and any other suitor.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have been informed that when Titus was adjudged an informer, there was some written stipulation entered into between his counsel and the District Attorney, allowing the matter to be reopened, as between him and the Government. I could not find that stipulation among the papers; but if I have not been misinformed as to its character, it has a very important bearing upon the present motion.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I agree with you that an early decision is desirable, and I hope that the argument and decision will be made as early as possible.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
