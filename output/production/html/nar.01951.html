           <span class="tei_ab">June 30, 1869.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In compromise of the Internal Revenue case of Henry H. Revill, of Georgia, submitted by your letter of the 29th inst., Revill proposes to pay as tax, $113,—as assessed penalty, 7.50—as specific penalty $50, and costs—by which is meant, I suppose, the legally taxable costs.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It appears that certain property has been seized, and security taken that the same shall be "forthcoming in Court"—and that the case was reported to the United States Attorney for suit.—It does not distinctly appear that any suit or proceeding in court has actually been commenced, in which case only is the recommendation of the Attorney General required. I deem, however, the compromise, a proper one to be made.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The papers are herewith returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
