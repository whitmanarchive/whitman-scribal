            <span class="tei_ab">January 23d, 1867</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. R. McBride</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Ch. Justice, Sup. Court, Idaho Ter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am directed by the Attorney Gen'l. to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ult. &amp; to
            say in reply that the Statute which established this office, makes it his duty to answer questions of law
            only when propounded by the President or the head of some Executive Department. To do otherwise would be, in
            the Attorney Gen's opinion, a violation of his duty, besides committing him beforehand upon points which
            might afterward arise in the regular course of administration. He begs therefore that you will excuse him for
            not giving an opinion on the question to which you refer.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, M. F. Pleasants, Ch. Clerk</span>
