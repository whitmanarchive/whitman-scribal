            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of to-day, with three deeds from Abraham Webb to Webb &amp; Cuniffe, enclosed. The Attorney General is not the person to whom such a claim against the United States should be presented,—nor is he authorized to express any opinion upon it, except upon questions of land relating to it, if asked of him by the President or the Head of a Department. As I am not certain that you desire the enclosures of your letter transmitted to any other officer of the United States, I return them enclosed herewith.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obd't serv't.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Act'g Attorney General.</span>
