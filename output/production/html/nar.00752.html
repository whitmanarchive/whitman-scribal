           <span class="tei_ab">January 23, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. C. P. Clever,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Delegate from New Mexico,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I had the honor to receive your letter of the 4th inst. requesting leave of absence from the Territory for ninety days for John Pratt, Esq. the Marshal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am not disposed to grant leave of absence to the officials of
            
            
            the Territories, unless upon occasions of personal or family interests, approaching, at least, the character of necessity. The absence of Mr. Justice Brocchus, which you refer to as giving an opportunity for the absence of the Marshal, was without leave,—and he has, I supposed, before this, returned. I shall regret it if any very great inconvenience shall be experienced by Marshal Pratt from this necessity of remaining in attendance upon the duties of his office; but on the application, as it now stands, I do not think it compatible with the public service to grant the desired leave.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
