           <span class="tei_ab">July 7, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Lyman Trumbull,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Senate United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to transmit herewith papers, consisting of a copy of the record and other printed matter attached, in the case of United States appellants, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. Simon Stevens, No. 343, December, term, 1867; a copy of a statement from the appellee to the Secretary of War; a note from the same to the same—a note from the Hon. William M. Evarts to the same—and, also, two letters from the War Department, referring these papers to me, with a request that I should take appropriate action in the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is a case in which an appeal was taken by the late Solicitor of the Court of Claims, at the request of the former Secretary of War, from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff below, and in which some arrangement was made, looking to the manner of submitting, and the time for trial of the cause—with which circumstances subsequently interfered.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The claimant asks that the appeal be "withdrawn." It appears that you stand in the relation of special counsel for the United States in this cause—and as under the Act which took effect on the 1st inst. there is no official counsel as yet in either the Court of Claims, or the Supreme Court, myself excepted, I have thought it proper to thus refer to you the whole matter presented in these papers, and commend it to your early determination.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, with great respect, yours, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">O. H. Browning,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">int</span>.</span>
