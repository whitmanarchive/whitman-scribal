            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I enclose the copy of a letter from M. C. Metcalf to the District Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which that officer has transmitted to me.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am not aware of any authority in this Department to stop such proceedings as Mr. Metcalf apprehends, to wit: proceedings under the State law to prohibit a nuisance. It is probable that his object is to have the services of the law officer of the United States in his defence against such proceedings. He does not show his relation to the Navy Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Will you be good enough to inform me whether he sustains to that Department any such relation as will justify the Department of Justice in assuming his defence against the apprehended proceedings.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very resp'lly &amp;c.</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman, Att'y Gen'l.</span>
