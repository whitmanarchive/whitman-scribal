            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 4, 1866.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">To</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. W. H. Seward,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have examined the letter of Gov. Holden, of North Carolina, which you have referred to this office. I find that Gov. Holden requests you to inform him whether a person who has not taken the amnesty oath prescribed in the President's Proclamation of May 29, 1865, &amp; who refuses to take that oath, is eligible to office in North Carolina. Upon such a question so presented, it does not seem to me that I have authority to give an official opinion; &amp; I find that the established usage of this Office is to the same effect. I am, therefore, compelled to decline further action upon the question, &amp; beg you to advise Gov. Holden of the ground upon which compliance with his request cannot be granted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
