            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Moses Hallett,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Ch. Just. S. C. Denver, Col. T.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have rec'd your letter of the 5th inst. relative to the removal of Hon. C. F. Holly, late Associate Justice of your Supreme Court, &amp; have to say, in reply, that it has never been the practice to notify persons whose appointments are made through this office, of the fact of their removal. I transmit you herewith a certified transcript from the books of the President's office, in relation to the appointment of Mr. Gorsline, which, in addition to the certificate of the Secretary of the Senate, I hope may prove sufficient.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery, Att'y Gen'l.</span>
