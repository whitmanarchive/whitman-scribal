            <span class="tei_ab">February 8, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. D. Cox,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Interior.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to transmit herewith a letter sent me by Henry Beard, Esq. dated the 5th inst., with the papers therewith enclosed, all relating to a bill in equity filed in the Circuit Court for the 9th Judicial Circuit, State of California, against Fitzwilliam Redding, for the purpose of annulling a land patent. This bill was filed by the late United States Attorney for California, without any instructions from this office, but I do not know whether or not he was instructed to file the bill by you. The request of Mr. Beard is that the bill be dismissed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Will you please inform me what your wishes are in the premises—as the subject matter is one under the control of your Department?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will thank you to return the accompanying papers when you are done with them.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
