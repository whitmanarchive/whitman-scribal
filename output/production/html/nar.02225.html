         <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 6, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Noah Davis, U.S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In answer to yours of the 5th instant, suggesting the employment of General Butler in the prosecution against Richard Baker, Jr. without expense to the Government, I have to say that I should with the greatest pleasure appoint General Butler your special assistant as you desire, if I could do so under the Constitution and laws. But I have uniformly refused to commission members of Congress as assistants either to the Attorney General, or to the District Attorneys, considering that such an appointment is made an office by the 17th section of the Act to establish the Department of Justice, (16 U.S. Stat. 164-5,) which a member of Congress is prohibited from holding by the Sixth Section of Article I of the Constitution.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
