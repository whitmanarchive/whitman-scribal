            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 13, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. Hubley Ashton,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 12th instant, transmitting the account of J. R.
                Beckwith, Esq. U. S. Attorney for the District of Louisiana for services rendered at
                your 
              
                 
              request in obtaining
                proof in New Orleans, to be used before the U. S. and Mexican Claims Commission, in
                the matter of the claim of James Marin vs. The United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The account is not receipted, and is herewith enclosed to you. You will be pleased
                to return it to Mr. Beckwith for his receipt, and when it shall have been received
                at the Department with your approval, it will be allowed. The amount is a matter for
                you to decide. The services having been performed at your request, I think that, as
                you are the best judge of their value, you should determine the amount that is to be
                paid for them. There has been no correspondence with Mr. Beckwith by this Department
                upon the subject of these services.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney General.</span>
