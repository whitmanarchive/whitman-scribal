            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 9, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Enoch G. Adams, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Vancouver, Washington Terr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 20th ultimo, and although as a general rule I find it unsafe to pay attention to communications written under the impulse of strong personal feeling, the information which I have received of you from Mr. Tullock
                
                leads me to suppose that your case may constitute an exception to the rule.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is exceedingly difficult to ascertain the truth in regard to individuals in distant parts of the country.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not recollect that any complaint has been made against Mr. Holmes except by yourself. If you know of any specific instances of official impropriety, you will oblige me by stating them.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">While of course this Department cannot concern itself in local or personal feuds, it has every desire that the Government shall be worthily represented in all parts of the country.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
