            <span class="tei_ab">To the President.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to enclose herewith the papers which you referred to this office in the case of J. S. Cowsden, in prison in New Jersey for counterfeiting. On the 26th ultimo I transmitted these papers to the Attorney General, and on the 29th ultimo he made the recommendation which you will find on the back of the report of the pardon clerk of this office, considering that this is a case for executive clemency.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Since the receipt of this recommendation of the Attorney General the papers have been referred to the Solicitor of the Treasury, who has approved, in writing, the report of the detective officer, Mr. Wood, which you will find among the papers.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">With great respect,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. Hubley Ashton,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Act'g Attorney General.</span>
