            <span class="tei_ab">May 21, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hugo Von Block,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">129 Atlantic street,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Brooklyn, N. Y.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span> has received your letter of the 12th instant, in which you enclose certificate of your discharge from the United States military service—which I herewith return to you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your object is to collect bounty money, which you claim to be due from the government,—and as the Judge Advocate General informed you that the decision against you was in conformity to the opinion of the Attorney General, you have submitted your case to this office. But we have nothing whatever to do with the settlement of claims, and the advice which has been given by the Attorney General, which is referred to by General Holt, was the opinion of the former as to the meaning of the law, which, having given, this office has done with the matter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
