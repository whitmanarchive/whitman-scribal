           <span class="tei_ab">July 9, 1869</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter, and the accompanying papers, all relating to the Internal Revenue case of A. W. Darling. I understand that the proposition is that the information of forfeiture be dismissed, each party thereto paying his own costs; that the money, amounting to about $19,000, now in the registry of the court, in the information for forfeiture, be applied in satisfaction <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pro tanto</span> of the judgment against Darling on the bonds, but that this amount of money be not received as a satisfaction in full of such judgment, and that all criminal proceedings now pending against Darling or others be unaffected by this compromise, and that the same is made without prejudicing the rights
            
            
            of either the United States or the persons indicted, in regard to such criminal proceedings.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As Darling is unable to pay the whole amount of the judgment on the bonds, and as the result of a new trial of the information of forfeiture is not certain, the proposed compromise seems pecuniarily for the interests of the United States. I do not certainly know whether there is, or is not, an informer who claims a share of whatever money may be recovered in the information of forfeiture. I infer from the letter of the District Attorney, found among the accompanying papers, that there is one.—If the compromise proposed is effected, the money received is in satisfaction <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pro tanto</span> of a debt of which an informer is entitled to no share. The United States have the legal right to proceed in this manner—but it ought, I think to be carefully considered, whether this is a case in which it is in every respect just to shut out any claim on the part of the informer. This consideration I leave entirely to the Department of the Treasury, and intend to express no opinion upon it, but to call attention to it, that it may not escape notice.—Understanding that terms of the proposed compromise as I have stated them, I recommend that they be accepted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar, Attorney General.</span>
