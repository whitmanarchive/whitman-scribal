            <span class="tei_ab">March 23, 1870.</span>

            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 22d instant, in which you ask to be informed of whom you can procure a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the subject of the liability of the government to pay One hundred dollars bounty to all soldiers who enlisted in 1861, for three years,— without reference to the period of actual service, or cause of discharge; and have to say, in reply, that the decision you refer to, is, I suppose, in the case of The United States, appellants, vs. Henry J. Hosmer, No. 102, December Term, 1869—an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Claims,— and that a copy of the decision can be obtained of D. W. Middleton, Esq. Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C.</span>
    <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Ass't. Attorney General.</span>
