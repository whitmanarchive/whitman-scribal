           <span class="tei_ab">October 19, 1870.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 14th inst. enclosing a communication to you from James R. Weaver, Esq. U. S. Consul at Antwerp, reporting that the master of the American ship "Richard Robinson" left George Edwards, a colored seaman, at the port, on the 16th of Sept. last, in violation of Section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1825, known as the "Crimes Act."</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">The letter of Mr. Weaver does not state the port to which the vessel belongs, the port to which she sailed from Antwerp, or the name of the master.— Without a knowledge of these facts, it is impossible to direct the proper officer to commence a prosecution for the offence. Will you do me a favor to obtain from the consul the necessary information upon these points? Upon the receipt of such information, directions will be given to the proper District Attorney to institute proceedings against the offender as soon as he shall be within reach of the process of our courts—and the requisite evidence can be obtained.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am sir, with great respect,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
