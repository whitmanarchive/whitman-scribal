            <span class="tei_ab">April 10, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. J. D. Jones,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Vienna, Maries Co. Missouri.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received yours of the 4th instant.</span>
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">The circular which you enclose is the work of some swindler who hopes to induce you to send him money, under a promise to supply you with counterfeit money. If you should send him the money which he asks, it is not likely that you would receive any of the counterfeit, but only waste paper or sawdust, or some such material; for that is the usual course of these persons.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">But whether you would get counterfeit money or not is a matter of no consequence in the view which every honest man must take of the subject. I advise you to have nothing to do with the business,—neither with the man, with his saw-dust, with his brown paper, or with his counterfeit money, if he has any.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
