            <span class="tei_ab">Benj. D. Silliman, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Counsellor at Law, New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am in receipt of your letter of the 24th inst. relative to certain cases between private parties, on writ of error in the Supreme Court, involving certain questions affecting the rights of the United States. I believe it is usual, in such cases, that the burthen of an application to the Court for the advancement of the causes should be taken by the party desiring it, unless the Head of the proper Department should request the Attorney General to intervene, on behalf of the Government, &amp; coöperate with the interested party in making the motion.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I think it proper, therefore, that I should refer your letter to the Sec. of the Treasury, &amp; obtain an expression of his wish in respect to the cases which you mention.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery, Att'y. Gen.</span>
