            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 18, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Lyman Trumbull,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir: Judge Blodgett, of Illinois, has submitted to me the draft of a bill for supplying the records of the U.S. Courts, destroyed by the Chicago fire—and of a joint resolution for the relief of Mr. Campbell, the Marshal. He informs me that he has sent similar papers to you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As he invites my criticism I transmit herewith his draft of the joint resolution, with an interlineation in pencil, which it seems to me will provide against a possible misconstruction.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have no suggestion to make on the subject of the bill.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
