            <span class="tei_ab">Clerk of the Sup. Ct. of N. M.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Santa Fé, New Mexico.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 10th inst. relating to the Vigil case, and have to-day sent a writ of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">certiorari</span> to U. S. Attorney Elkins, to be served upon the Judges of your court. I have to thank you for having prepared a complete transcript of the cause, which can be annexed and returned with the writ of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">certiorari</span>,—with a statement, however, that what is included between certain pages, naming them, are all the proceedings in said cause had since the 6th day of April, 1868, as the writ of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">certiorari</span> specifically calls for the proceedings had since that day, particularly all those allowing an appeal in said case <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nunc pro tunc</span> to the Supreme Court of the United States. But as a full record has been prepared, I see no reason why it might not all be sent up.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
