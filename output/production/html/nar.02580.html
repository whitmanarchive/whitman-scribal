            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 10, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Pietro Cunce, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upper Sandusky, Ohio</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span> 
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received yours of the 30th ultimo, transmitting that of Mr. Ernst, of the 29th ultimo.</span>
          <span class="tei_ab">While I have much sympathy for Mr. Ernst, and feel indignant at the persecution to which he has been subjected, I do not think that the wrongs which he has suffered are such as can be redressed by the laws of the United States. The absence of actual violence,
              
              
              
              and of proof of a conspiracy to perpetrate violence, is, as you properly suggest, an insuperable difficulty in the way of righting his wrongs, by the laws of the United States. Mere illiberality in political sentiments, and an unwillingness to give a man employment on account of his politics, however censurable in a moral point of view, are not of themselves offences against the law.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I pray that you will make known to Mr. Ernst the contents of this letter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
