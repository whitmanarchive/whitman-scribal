           <span class="tei_ab">February 3, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Lyman Trumbull,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chairman of the Judiciary Committee,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have seen a copy of a bill passed by the House of Representatives, providing that the laws of the several States shall govern, as to the competency of witnesses, in all criminal trials, in the Courts of The United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I understand that the real object
            
                 
            
            
            of this bill is to allow the accused parties to testify in their own favor. The bill will have an unexpected effect in repealing the Civil Rights bill, so far as it relates to the testimony of colored men. In Kentucky the State law excludes people of that race.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If the bill should be passed, I suggest that some such provisos as I enclose should be added to it. The propriety of the first proviso arises from this: in Georgia, by a law passed since the war, the accused in a case of felony, is permitted to make his own statement to the jury—not under oath, and without being subject to cross-examination. I think that this last exemption is wrong in principle, and it practically operates to the advantage of white offenders, as compared with colored offenders,—and I think that this consequence should be guarded against.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
