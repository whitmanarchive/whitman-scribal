            <span class="tei_ab">J. B. Husbands, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Paducah, Kentucky.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 10th inst. with its enclosure. The petition for the pardon of Wm. Canfield will be transmitted to Judge Advocate Gen'l Holt, who has jurisdiction in the case. This office can do nothing but refer the papers, as Canfield was tried by Court Martial, &amp; the Bureau of Military Justice is the proper &amp; only office where such cases are investigated.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">By order of the Attorney General,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">F. U. Stitt,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Pardon Clerk.</span>
