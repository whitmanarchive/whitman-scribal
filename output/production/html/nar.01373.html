            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of to-day is received. The case is one of great difficulty, and I have freely communicated to the counsel who have appeared in it the difficulties which it presented. The last argument or suggestion of counsel was submitted to me but a few days ago. I was employed upon the case when your letter arrived, and was stopped in its consideration for the purpose of reading the letter. I was aware, of the desire of the parties interested to have as speedy a decision given as was practicable, and shared their wishes in that respect. As I have not had any communication with you as counsel in the case, it is perhaps hardly advisable at this stage of the proceedings to go into any more extended correspondence.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
