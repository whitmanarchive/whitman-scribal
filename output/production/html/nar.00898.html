            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ult. with enclosure, asking the official opinion of the Attorney General upon the application of the franking privilege to a case stated. It is the duty of the Attorney General to give his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the President of the United States, or when requested by the Heads
 
            
            
            of any of the Departments, touching any matters that may concern their Departments, but not otherwise;—and it is the practice not to give opinions in other cases. The question you ask can be brought officially before the Attorney General only by the President or the Postmaster General. The enclosures of your letter are herewith returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very resp. yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
