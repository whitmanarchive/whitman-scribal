           <span class="tei_ab">Concord, June 28, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. L. Kerr, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter informing me of your intention to resign your position as Clerk in the Attorney General's Department on the first of September next, instead of the first of August, as you at one time proposed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Though I agree with you in the opinion that it would be for your own interest to engage in some other permanent employment, your services in the office have been so entirely satisfactory that it will be perfectly agreeable to me to have you defer your resignation to the later time which you mention.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I hope I shall be able to find some one as faithful and attentive to take your place; and with the assurance of my personal good wishes,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">am, very truly yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
