            <span class="tei_ab">A. Sterling, Jr. Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Baltimore, Md.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am informed by the Secretary of the Treasury that a suit is pending in your city, (I believe in the U.S. Circuit Court) in favor of John M. Binckley ag'st E. A. Rollins, late Commissioner of Internal revenue, for alleged libel, based on a letter alleged to have been written to the President by Mr. Rollins, in the course of his official duty.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Treasury Department regards this as a case in which the Government should make provision for the defence; and therefore I request you to appear in behalf of the defendant, and to communicate immediately on the subject with Mr. Rollins, whose address I believe is Philadelphia, Penn. For this service a reasonable compensation will be allowed you, to be determined by this Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman, Attorney General.</span>
