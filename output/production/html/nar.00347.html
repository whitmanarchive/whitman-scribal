            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General further directs me to call your attention to the circular letter from this office, dated February 15th, 1866, a copy of which is herewith enclosed, and to say that a strict compliance with its requirements is essential to the proper transaction of the business of this Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully Yours,</span>
