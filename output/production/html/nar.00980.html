            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 27th ult., asking that a description of the boundaries of the Judicial Districts of the United States may be sent to you. I send you herewith a description of the boundaries of these Districts as recently made by a clerk in this Office from the Statutes at Large. This description has not yet been verified by the Attorney General, and he cannot vouch for its correctness—although it is probably correct.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. your obd't serv't.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
