           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">In order that there may be no mistake upon the subject of your professional relation to the government as counsel for the United States, in the cases in the middle and Eastern Districts of Tennessee, against certain Railroad Companies, in which you were employed by the Secretary of War, I now say to you that I consider your retainer by the War Department prior to the passage of the Act to establish the Department of Justice as still valid and in force—and that I earnestly desire that you will continue to represent the Government in those cases.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
