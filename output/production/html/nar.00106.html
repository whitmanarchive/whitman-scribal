           <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 25, 1866</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received yours of the 10th, enclosing a copy of an opinion, delivered by Judge Hawkins, of Tennessee, holding so much of the Internal Revenue Act of June 30, 1864, as imposes a stamp tax upon Writs, &amp; other original process issued by State Courts to be unconstitutional.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon a careful consideration of this opinion, I adhere to the position expressed in my letter to you of September 1st, that this portion of the Act is valid &amp; constitutional.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It would be a useless waste of time to go at large into this question, as there is only one course by which it can be set at rest, &amp; this is, by instituting prosecution, as I have advised in my former letter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
