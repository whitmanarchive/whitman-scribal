            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 4, 1871,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">S. P. Harlow, Esq.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Marshal,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Brooklyn, N. Y.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">In answer to your letter of the 1st instant, on the subject of the injury done to a lad by a ball, shot by the Deputy U.S. Marshal in the alleged course of his duty—and of a compromise of the matter—I have to say that I have no power or disposition to authorize any compromise in the case.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">The act of the Deputy Marshal was lawful or unlawful. If lawful, he ought not to suffer; and it is to be presumed that the courts will exonerate him. If unlawful, he ought to suffer; and I am aware of no liability on the part of the Government to make good his defaults. Moreover, I know of no fund out of which the compromise could be paid.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Should a suit be commenced, and should I be satisfied that it is for an act done in the line of duty, the proper officer will be directed to appear in defence.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
