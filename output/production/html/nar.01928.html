            <span class="tei_ab">June 19, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have read your letter of this date just received, with the accompanying papers, which were addressed to your Department by Mr. Roberts, Minister from Spain, relative to alleged illegal proceedings in New York, with reference to Cuba. Mr. Roberts should cause to be prepared an affidavit of the person or persons who know the facts stated in his paper, to be laid before the District Attorney at New York forthwith. Without such an affidavit, that officer would not have the means of procuring the indictment and arrest of the persons implicated.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will telegraph to the Marshal at New York to keep a watch upon the places referred to.—I return the papers, as you request, and recommend that they be sent to the District Attorney at New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to remain</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Yours respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
