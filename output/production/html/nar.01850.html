           <span class="tei_ab">May 4, 1871.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Edwards Pierrepont,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">New York City.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">The Hon. H. W. Slocum has transmitted to me, with his recommendation, an application of Mr. G. V. Harriott, for the dismissal of the appeal in the case of the will of Charles Fox. He represents that the contestants of the will are children of the deceased brother of the testator, respectively eight, ten, and two years of age, who are in needy circumstances.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Will you inform me what is the truth on the subject of these statements, and also of the respective values of the personal and real estate disposed of by Fox's will? And will you also give me your opinion upon the question whether there are any moral equities that ought to induce the United States to forbear to assert its rights under the will?</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman, Attorney Gen'l.</span>
