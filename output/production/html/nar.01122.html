           <span class="tei_ab">A. D. Robinson, Esq.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General's Office,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Court of Claims Rooms,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Capitol,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 21st instant, with the printed copy of the petition in the U. S. Court of Claims in the suit entitled The Portland Company <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. The United States, enclosed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Talbot said to me that there were reasons why he could not properly argue the case before the Court of Claims, and asked me to do so for him, which I promised to do. I desire that, in all things relating to taking testimony in the case, and getting it ready for trial, you will do everything which, in your opinion, is necessary to establish all the facts, and bring properly before the court all questions of law in the case, and give me at least two weeks' notice of the time it will be called for trial, that I may properly prepare myself for the argument in it. I do not understand that it is at all necessary for me to have anything to do with the preparation of the Case, except in the argument— but if you think it is, I will thank you to give me notice. I shall rely on you to take care of and watch the case, and give me timely notice if
                
              
            I am wanted in it.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
