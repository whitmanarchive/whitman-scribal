           <span class="tei_ab">February 6, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo, requesting me to give you my official opinion as to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a charge of $5500: made by the counsel employed on behalf of the Government in the cases of Tweed <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. Flanders for the labor apparently performed by them in those cases. While I would be very happy to give my individual opinion upon this subject, if I were possessed of the data for the formation of a judgment upon the question mentioned, I regret that I cannot communicate to you an official opinion upon that question, which is one of fact and not of law, and therefore not within the scope of the authority and duty of my office. I must, therefore, respectfully decline expressing any official opinion upon the question which you have done me the honor to refer to me in your late communication.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
