           <span class="tei_ab">July 23, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Lyman Trumbull,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Senate of the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to recall your attention to a letter from the Hon. O. H. Browning, Attorney General <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span>, of date the 7th instant, addressed to you on the subject of a suit in which the United States are appellants, and Simon Stevens is respondent, now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States. Allow me respectfully to request that you will enable me to make an appointment with the Secretary of War for a conference with you on that subject, in which I might be able to say
            
            
            what seems to me proper in connection with it. My position in reference to the case, as having been consulted in it in my private professional capacity before I assumed this office, makes it very desirable for me that the question now under consideration should be promptly disposed of, one way or the other.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>

            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
