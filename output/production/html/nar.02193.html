            <span class="tei_ab">Richard Crowley, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Lockport, N. Y.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing the account of William Hildreth, Deputy Marshal, for services in the matter of E. S. Rowland, 2d Lieut, 2d Missouri Light Artillery, charged with having presented a false claim against the Government, has been received. Mr. Hildreth's account is made out against the War Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">When you were directed to make inquiry into the facts, and institute prosecution against Rowland, if evidence of guilt should be found, I did not intend to authorize you to subject the Government to any expense in the inquiry.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">There being one fund under the control of this Department out of which this account can be paid, I have sent it to the War Department for consideration and proper action there.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
