            <span class="tei_ab">June 2, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 22d ult. with papers enclosed, all relating to the case of M. O. Barnes, arising under the Internal Revenue laws. Complaint has been made against Mr. Barnes, charging him with carrying on the business of a retail dealer in liquors, at Strawberry Point, Iowa, without having paid the special tax required by law,— and he proposes to pay all taxes due, and the costs, if the complaint be dismissed. Having read the papers enclosed with your letter, I recommend that the case be compromised on these terms.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The papers are returned herewith</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
