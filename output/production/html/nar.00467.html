           <span class="tei_ab">March 16, 1868</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. O. H. Browning,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">int</span>.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I desire to call your attention to the fact that the "Act making appropriations for the legislative, executive and judicial expenses of the government for the year ending the thirtieth of June, Eighteen hundred and sixty‑nine," provides "for salaries of the Attorney General, Assistant Attorney General, Law Clerk, and Chief Clerk, two clerks of class four, two clerks of class three, one clerk of class one, and one messenger."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">By the Act of March 3, 1865, this office was allowed the force above named, "besides such temporary clerks as may from time to time be needed—provided, however, that the allowance to such temporary clerks
                
                shall in no one year exceed one thousand dollars."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The appropriation acts for the years ending June 30, 1866, and June 30, 1867, and June 30, 1868, provided for two additional temporary clerks of class one, one of which places was occupied till August, 1867, and the other is still required by the exigencies of the office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The clerical force allowed for the next financial year is sufficient for the ordinary routine work of the Department; but would be insufficient should any calls be made upon it similar to the calls for Pardon Reports by Congress during the present year.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Some provision should be made for such a contingency.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The necessities of the office in the way of additional professional help are well known to the Assistant Attorney General, to whom you are respectfully referred for information relating thereto.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is proper to remind you that the Appropriation Act has passed the House and is now before the Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The sum allowed for contingent expenses, namely for fuel, labor, furniture, stationery, and miscellaneous items, Five thousand dollars, may suffice, with the most rigid economy. A deficiency in that, however, can be supplied, hereafter, while provision for additional clerical help must be made now, if at all.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chief Clerk.</span>
