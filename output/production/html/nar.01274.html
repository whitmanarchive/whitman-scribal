           <span class="tei_ab">March 26, 1870.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. A. R. Meek,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General of Florida,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Tallahassee.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of March 19, inst. is received. I have not before me any request from the Secretary of the Treasury for an opinion upon the question to which you refer, and cannot suppose that I shall receive any, as it does not seem to me to be a matter with which I have any official concern. If I should receive an application from him for an opinion, and should think that I ought to give it, I shall endeavor to do it at as early a date as my other duties will permit.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
