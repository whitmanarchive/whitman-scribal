            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to enclose a copy of the instructions which have to-day been sent to the District Attorney of North Carolina in relation to the settlement of the case of the "Hornet" or "Cuba," and which are, I believe, in conformity with the wishes of the President, as communicated to me by you. I enclose with them the bond which has been given by the claimant of the vessel, as a condition of the settlement, and a check for $2500, paid by the claimant in settlement of such of the expenses incurred by the United States, in relation to the witnesses, etc. as it has been agreed he should pay.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
