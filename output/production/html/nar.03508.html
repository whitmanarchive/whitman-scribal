            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 2, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. R. W. Tayler,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">First Comptroller of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing a copy of the official bond of William Spence, as
            
            
            
            Marshal of the United States for the Middle District of Tennessee. The bond not having been made strictly in conformity with the regulations issued by this Department to Marshals, relative to executing their bonds, you enquire whether in my opinion it should be accepted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply I have to inform you that in all such matters a rigid adherence to the regulations of the Department should be insisted upon, and therefore I would suggest that you inform Marshal Spence that until his bond has been made in accordance with the instructions sent to him, it will not be approved by you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It may be that in this case the sureties who have executed the bond before the judge are sufficient; but I think upon general principles, as above stated, that you should require a strict conformity to the regulations on such important matters as the bonds of Marshals of the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
            
            <span class="tei_ab">P. S. the copy of the bond is herewith returned.</span>
