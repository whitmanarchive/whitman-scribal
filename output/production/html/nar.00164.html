            <span class="tei_ab">Representations having been made to me from reliable persons that the confinement of Mr. Davis at Fortress Monroe is more onerous &amp; severe than his safe custody requires. I beg to suggest that you cause an order to be issued to the commandment at the Fortress to relax the rigor of the prisoner's confinement so far as may be compatible with his safe custody.</span>
