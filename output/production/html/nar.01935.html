            <span class="tei_ab">June 26, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Referring to the letter of the Attorney General to you of June 21st inst. relating to the case of H. J. Noyes, arising under the Internal Revenue laws, in which the Attorney General declined to recommend a compromise, mainly on the ground that credit was given by the United States, I have to say that it has been represented to the Attorney General that this is an exceptional case, and that there are reasons why the terms of the compromise, as proposed by the Commissioner, should be accepted. I am accordingly instructed by him to recommend a compromise of that suit on the terms proposed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I transmit herewith the papers which have been handed me by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
