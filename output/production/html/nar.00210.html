<span class="tei_ab">May 2, 1867.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">James C. Kennedy, Esq.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Your letter of yesterday has been received. This Office is not advised of the character &amp; condition of the litigation to which you refer, &amp; cannot undertake to give any instructions relative to the suit against the Trustees of Bayne &amp; Co., mentioned in the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If such suit is to be brought by the United States, none other than the law officer of the particular District has authority to institute it; but the Secretary of the Treasury may associate with him, in the trial of the cause, such special counsel as he may choose to employ.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If the District Attorney for Baltimore desires any instructions relative to the proposed litigation, it will be his duty to communicate directly with this Office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If you consult the Secretary of the Treasury, he will doubtless address the Attorney General on the subject of this case, &amp; state the particular instructions which he may desire to be sent to the District Attorney at Baltimore.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is manifestly proper that the Secretary of the Treasury should consider the subject-matter of your letter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The letters accompanying your communication are herewith returned.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, &amp;c. yours,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">J. Hubley Ashton,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney Gen'l.</span>
