           <span class="tei_ab">January 31, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">R. W. Taylor, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">1st Comptroller of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 7th of November last, the Attorney General approved the account, duly certified, and amounting to Three hundred and seventy-five dollars, ($375:) of M. L. Perkins, for services as assistant to the United States Attorney for the Western Dist. of Tennessee, for the quarter ending the 2d November, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 7th instant, the Attorney General approved, by an oversight, another account of the same person, of the same amount, and for similar services, for the quarter ending December 31, 1867.— Both these accounts have been paid, an error thus occurring, of the amount of Mr. Perkins's salary for more than a month.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Perkins has ceased to act as assistant United States Attorney, and you are informed of these facts, that proper steps may be taken to correct the error, and collect the amount erroneously paid him.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney Gen'l.</span>
