            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I ask of you the favor of information, if you are able to give it, in relation to a letter supposed to have been written to the War Department, recommending the settlement of the claim of William H. Goodspeed, for compensation for the services of the "Silver Star."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">After diligent search, both in the principal office, and in that of the branch having in charge the business of the Court of Claims, we are unable to find the record of such a letter. But Mr. Mc Michael has been informed in the latter office that such a letter was written by you. Can you give me any information upon the subject, and very much oblige.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
