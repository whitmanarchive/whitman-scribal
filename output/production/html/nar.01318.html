            <span class="tei_ab">April 12, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Henry Stanbery,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Cincinnati, Ohio.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">My dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The case involving the naturalization question was reached to-day in the Supreme Court, and no counsel appearing on the other side, your letter was read to the court. As they preferred not to consider the case <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ex</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">parte</span>, they decided to postpone it until the first Tuesday of December next, and directed that your cause, involving the same question, should stand for argument at the same time. I understand that a telegram to the same effect has already been sent you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I hope this arrangement will prove agreeable to you—and am,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very truly yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
