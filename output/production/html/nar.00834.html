            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Edward Jordan,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Solicitor of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to state that I have received the following telegram from Henry S. Fitch, U. S. Attorney for Georgia: "I deem it my duty to report that it is currently rumored that the U. S. Marshal for this State has absconded. I have called the Court's attention to the matter. Shall I examine his bonds &amp; papers?" Signed Henry S. Fitch, U. S. Attorney, &amp; dated Atlanta, March 12, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In as much as your office may be charged with the duty of instituting inquiry into the pecuniary transactions of the Marshal with a view to protect the interests of the government, I deem it proper to communicate to you this information.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very resp. yours.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
