            <span class="tei_ab">December 27, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from A. B. Maynard, Esq. U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, together with a communication accompanying it, both relating to an action against Messrs. Robinson and Brown, as endorsers of a forged assignment of a claim for bounty, etc., and in which The U. S. Attorney asks instructions from this Department as to whether he shall commence proceedings in the proper court.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As this is a matter, the prosecution of which is under the advice of the honorable the 2d Auditor, and, as I am informed, there is evidence in his office of the truth of the case, which will enable this Department to judge more fairly than it can now do, of the justice and expediency of discontinuing the action, I respectfully request that it be referred as speedily as possible, to the 2d Auditor, in order that he may furnish any facts in his possession pertinent to the case—and also express his opinion as to the propriety 
            
            
            
            
            of further proceedings against Messrs. Robinson and Brown.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">and Acting Attorney General.</span>
