            <span class="tei_ab">Aug. 24, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John L. Henry, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Tyler, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In answer to your letter
            of the 14th instant, I have to say that
            it is held in this Department that any
            retainers of counsel made by other
            Departments prior to the 1st day of July,
            1870, the day on which the Act establishing
            the Department of Justice took
            effect, were not dissolved by that Act—its prohibitions on Heads of Departments
            to employ counsel being only
            operative in the future, and not
            necessarily terminating contracts then
            in existence for services in pending
            cases.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Under this view, inasmuch
            as your employment by Supervisor
            Bridgland under the authority of the
            Internal Revenue Bureau seems to have
            been prior to that date, it seems to me
            that you still sustain the relation of
            counsel to the Government in the cases
            embraced within your contract with
            Mr. Bridgland. Having been employed
            at the instance of the Commissioner of
            Internal Revenue, your compensation
            will properly come from the Treasury
            Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I return the papers which you enclosed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
