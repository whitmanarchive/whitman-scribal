            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of War <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad interim</span> has inquired of the Attorney General whether the compensation claimed by District Attorneys for their services in connection with the examination of Titles of real estate under negotiation to the government, should be paid out of funds under the direction of the Department contracting for the lands, or otherwise. Before entering upon the question, it is desirable that the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">practice</span> of the accounting officers with respect to that particular emolument of Dist. Attorneys should be before the Attorney General, with information expressly whether the clause of the circular from this office of 4 June, 1857, (copy sent herewith,) is regarded as influencing the practice.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obedient serv't,</span>
