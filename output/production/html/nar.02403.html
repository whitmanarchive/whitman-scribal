            <span class="tei_ab">Aug. 15, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Abraham Stow, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">No. 35 Park Place</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Brooklyn, N. Y.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">At length, I have been able to give some examination to your communications asking that the Government defend the suit of Woolhopter against yourself. As at present advised, I do not see that, under the law, I am at liberty to assume the defence. The transaction out of which the suit grows, was entirely of a private character. Your account is that you bought cotton of Woolhopter, paid for a small part of it, and then that the cotton, or its proceeds, was taken from you by U. S. officials. Woolhopter sues you for the purchase money.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You think that inasmuch as the Government got the cotton from you, it ought to assume the defence of this suit. I know of no authority for assuming such defence. But if you should be compelled to pay for the cotton which the Government took, it seems to me that the question may then come up, whether the Government should not indemnify you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have caused some investigation to be instituted in the Treasury Department, and if anything should be produced which changes my present views, I will communicate further with you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
