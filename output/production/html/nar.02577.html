            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 10, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Marion Bethune,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Talbotton, Georgia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span> 
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 20th ultimo. I know of no way by which you can be paid for administering the oath in 1865, unless it should appear that the service was ordered by some proper authority at Washington. I do not know enough of the machinery then in operation to have a clue for inquiry.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I suggest that you learn from Judge Johnson whether he gave direction to the Ordinary in pursuance of authority from Washington—and if so from what Department. This may at least put one on the track of inquiry.</span>
            
            <span class="tei_ab">Very truly yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Amos T. Akerman.</span>
