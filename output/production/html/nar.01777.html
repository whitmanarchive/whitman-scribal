            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, inquiring as to the title of property known as the Hot Springs of Arkansas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 11th day of June Past, an Act was passed by Congress, which you will find on page 149, U. S. Stat. vol. 16. Certain parties have brought suit in the Court of Claims, as authorized by that Act, and an answer has been put in on the part of the United States,— and the case thus stands upon the docket of that Court, to be disposed of in its order.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
