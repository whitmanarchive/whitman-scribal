            <span class="tei_ab">June 9, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. W. Mungen,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Findlay, Ohio.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., in which you ask me two questions relating to the Revenue laws of the U. S. I have no right to give you my opinion upon these questions. In any case before a Court, involving them, the Judge must decide, so far as that case is concerned,—and in the administration of the law, the Dept. of the Treasury establishes the rule it will follow; and it is my duty to give an opinion only when requested by the President, or the head of a Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp, yourt obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
