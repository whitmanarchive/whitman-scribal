            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Talbot writes to me that he thinks such a letter as I mentioned to you in relation to the claim of William H. Goodspeed, for services of the steamer "Silver Star," was written by him in the spring of 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">He suggests that it may not have been addressed to the Secretary of War, but to the Quartermaster General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Will you search for the record of such a letter, and advise me of the result?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
