            <span class="tei_ab">It is not the duty of this office to instruct officers of the Internal Revenue, but I may state, what no doubt you already know, that the President has appointed and commissioned John P. O'Neill, Esq. to be District Attorney for that District—and that he has taken the official oath. These are the only facts which it is deemed necessary to mention.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. Hubley Ashton, Act'g Attorney General</span>
