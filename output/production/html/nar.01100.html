            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. James G. Blaine,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Speaker of the House of Representatives.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The second section of the "Act making appropriations for the Legislative, Executive and Judicial expenses of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1870," directs a Report to Congress by the heads of the several Executive Departments of "the number of desks in their several Departments, the number of clerks in their several Departments, the number employed therein during the preceding fiscal year, when employed, and when discharged, and the amount of compensation received by each, and what reduction, if any, can be made in the number of clerks of each grade."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In compliance with this question I have the honor to Report that the number of clerks allowed to this Department by law is ten, classified as follows:
            <table class=" tei_table">
              <tr class=" tei_tr">
                <td class=" tei_td">One Law Clerk at an annual compensation of</td>
                <td class=" tei_td">$2,500</td>
              </tr>
            
             
            
            
              <tr class=" tei_tr">
                <td class=" tei_td">One chief clerk—annual compensation</td>
                <td class=" tei_td">$2,200</td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr class=" tei_tr">
                <td class=" tei_td">One clerk      "      "    </td>
                <td class=" tei_td">2000</td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr class=" tei_tr">
                <td class=" tei_td">Four clerks of class four</td>
                <td class=" tei_td">1,800</td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr class=" tei_tr">
                <td class=" tei_td">Two clerks of class three</td>
                <td class=" tei_td">1,600</td>
              </tr>
              
              <tr class=" tei_tr">
                <td class=" tei_td">One clerk of class one</td>
                <td class=" tei_td">1,200</td>
              </tr>
                 
            </table>
              </span>
            <span class="tei_ab">No vacancy occurred in these clerkships during the preceding fiscal year, and none has occurred during the present; and no changes have been made in these, except by resignation.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In addition there was also employed during the last year, as there is at present, one clerk at annual compensation of $1600— paid from the appropriation for "legal assistance, and other necessary expenditures in the disposal of private land claims in California."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">While this force may be sufficient for the purely clerical needs of the office it is not, in my opinion, susceptible of reduction, consistently with the public interests.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">with great respect,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
