           <span class="tei_ab">August 18, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">To the President:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I find on file in my office certain charges against Luther C. White, Marshal for the Western District of Arkansas, imputing to him misconduct in office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The nature and gravity of these charges make out a case of "misconduct in office," within the meaning of that phrase, as used in the 2d section of the Act of March 2, 1867, known as the Tenure of Civil Office Act—and the papers which I transmit herewith present "evidence," which, in the sense of the same section, may be "satisfactory to the President," of this misconduct.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If, upon examination of these papers, you should arrive at this conclusion, the case will be presented for your action, under the said section of said Act, to the effect of suspending said officer, and designating some suitable person to perform temporarily the duties of that office until the next meeting of
            
            
            the Senate, and until the case shall be acted upon by the Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I may add that I have held interviews with Mr. Boudinot, the Indian Chief, and with some respectable citizens of Arkansas, who have called upon me in support of the charges against Mr. White, and have been impressed with the feeling that a change in the office should be made.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, with great respect,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
