           <span class="tei_ab">June 29, 1868.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. O. H. Browning,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Interior,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In the letter of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior of the 23d instant, relating to the appointment of B. B. Andrews, Esq., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida, during his absence, I am informed that the appointment has been approved on the presumption that Mr. Usher has obtained from this office "the necessary leave to be absent from his District."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to say that Mr. Usher is absent form his post without the consent of the Attorney General. He has been called upon for an explanation, on receipt of which you will be duly advised of the action of the Attorney General. It is possible that the circumstances may have justified the absence.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
