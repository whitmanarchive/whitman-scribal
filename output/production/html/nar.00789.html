Att'y Elkins, dated the 2d inst.; and to say in reply that he knows of no such application - but from all he can learn he is pleased to be able to concur in your opinion of his value as a public officer, and the importance of retaining him.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Ch. Clerk.</span>
