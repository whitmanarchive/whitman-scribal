            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 10, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">D. J. Baldwin, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Galveston, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 2d instant in relation to the prosecution of David D. Whiting has been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your perplexity appears to have arisen from the use of the phrase "civil prosecution," which was quoted in my letter to you from a communication from the War Department. I suppose that this phrase was used in reference to a prosecution in the civil, as distinguished from the military courts.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Capt. Hodges being an officer of the army I suppose he either has been or will be proceeded against in a court martial. I do not understand that the War Department requests a civil suit, but only a criminal
            
            
            
            
            
                
            prosecution in the civil courts.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If I should learn that a suit against either White or Hodges, or both, for the recovery of the money, is desired, I will inform you. In the meanwhile I should be glad to have any information which you may obtain in reference to the probable productiveness of a civil suit.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
