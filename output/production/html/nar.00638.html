            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 19th instant has been received. This office has communicated its views in regard to the case of the steamboat Frolic, in previous correspondence with Mr. T. Sweeney, of Wheeling. The case will be determined at the next term of the Supreme Court. Cases involving the same question have been argued, and this one was continued, in order that the claimants might be represented by counsel.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, yours &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. Hubley Ashton,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
