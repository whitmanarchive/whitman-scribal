            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 11, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Thomas Bonner, Jr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Ashland, Clay Co. Ala.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 1st inst. to the President has been by him referred to me.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If the outrage of which you speak can be reached by the laws of the United States, the proper person to institute a prosecution is the U.S. District Attorney. That officer for the Southern District of Alabama is J. P. Southworth, of Mobile; for the Middle and Northern Districts, John A. Minnis, Esq. of Montgomery.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Not knowing in which District your county lies, I cannot tell which one of these you should address. But you will be able to determine, and I recommend that you address him at once, stating the facts, and the names of witnesses.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
