            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Binst &amp; Binst,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Charleston, S. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 15th I addressed you a hasty note, in answer to yours of the 11th.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">At that time I was too much engaged to give a careful attention to the subject, and perhaps did not understand the drift of your letter. Upon looking further into the matter, I am disposed to think that you had reference to treaties between this Government and Prussia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Though precluded by the rules of the office from giving Opinions on legal questions to private parties, I will refer you to the Opinion of Attorney General Cushing on the subject of Droit d'Aubaine, which you will find in vol. VIII of the Opinions of Attorneys General, p. 410.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
