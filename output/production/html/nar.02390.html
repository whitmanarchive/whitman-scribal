            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing an acc't against the United States of $205, for alleged expenses in the arrest of W. J. Stevens and others charged with counterfeiting.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter does not state whether the service was rendered at the instance of any Department or officer of the United States, or whether the arrests were made under any process from U. S. Courts.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As at present advised I do not know of any authority for paying your account. But desirous to indemnify you for any expenses incurred in serving the United States, if there is a law to authorize it, I shall be glad to have from you such information as you may be able to give, upon the points above suggested.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
