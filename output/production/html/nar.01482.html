            <span class="tei_ab">November 19, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. John Smith,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Albany, Linn Co.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Oregon.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Yours of the 4th instant, with the enclosures, has been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I think the intention of the parties was, not so much to distribute counterfeit money as to swindle you. If you were to send the money which these people ask, the probability is that you would receive by express nothing more than blank brown paper, cut in the shape of bills. Such has been the experience of some individuals who were so unwise as to test the matter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Information of similar fraudulent attempts comes to us often from all parts
            
            
            
            
            
            of the country. I will put your papers in the hands of the officer who has charge of the detective system, and who will cause the matter to be followed up, if any track can be found.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
