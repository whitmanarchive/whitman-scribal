            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The forms of indictment enclosed in your letter of the 17th instant have been carefully considered in this Department, and the only suggestion it is deemed worth while to make is that something like the matter of the enclosed memorandum shall be inserted at the proper places in forms one (I) and two, (II) and in the other forms when the cases are analagous.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">At the foot of the memorandum you will also find a list of authorities which may perhaps be serviceable to you.</span>
            
            
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">It is not probable, in view of the pressure of business here, that I shall be able to attend the Court at Columbia. I will communicate on the subject of assistance in a day or two.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
