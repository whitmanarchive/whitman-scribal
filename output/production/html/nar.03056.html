            <span class="tei_ab">May 5, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I return the bill of Warburton &amp; Courtney, New York, for services as phonographers, in the trial of a case in New York, enclosed in your letter of the 7th ultimo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Applications for pay for such services are not infrequent, and I have uniformly declined paying them.—The service was not authorized by this Department. While I have no doubt that it is a great convenience to counsel to have the aid of stenographers I do not feel at liberty to furnish that aid at the public expense, in view of the limited amount of the Judiciary fund.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
