            <span class="tei_ab">June 19, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. W. A. Richardson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of this date, with papers enclosed, all relating to a libel of information against the steamer Matilda arising under the Internal Revenue laws. The claimant proposes that on the payment of $50 as a penalty and the costs of suit, the libel be dismissed, and the steamer be restored him. I recommend that this compromise of the suit be made.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The papers are returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I remain, yours very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
