           <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 13 inst. requesting the return by the Attorney of the United States to the Commissioner of Pensions of the papers in the case of J. W.

            <span class="tei_ab">"Skinner has escaped, and his re-capture may reasonably be expected. The papers will be needed by the Patent Attorney in the further prosecution of the case."</span>
