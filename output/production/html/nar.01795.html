            <span class="tei_ab">March 25, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. H. H. Leavitt,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Cincinnati, Ohio.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 17th instant, in relation to an increase of the compensation of Mr. Bond, assistant District Attorney in your District. I had previously received communications on the same subject.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have held the matter under consideration in the hope of being able to do for Mr. Bond that which you request, and which his merits seem to authorize. I hesitate from an apprehension that the appropriation for the Judiciary fund, which the late Congress have, (perhaps unintentionally,) reduced, will not suffice to carry us through. In a few weeks, after the rush of business growing out of the sessions of Congress and the Supreme Court, is over, I shall be able to judge of the ability of the Department to make the required advance.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
