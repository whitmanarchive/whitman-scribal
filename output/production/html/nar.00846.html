          <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to enclose herewith a statement of the judgment, interest &amp; costs, in the case of Hiram Walker vs. Cyrus R. Crane, brought to the Sup. Court on Writ of Error from Vermont, which has been furnished to me by Mr. Senator Edmunds of counsel for the plaintiff below. The writ of error was dismissed with the consent of the Secretary of War conveyed by his letter of Feb. 6, 1869, to this office. This judgment, I understand, is one payable by the War Department.</span>
