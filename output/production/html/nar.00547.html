            <span class="tei_ab">May 28, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Dodge &amp; McClellan,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Present.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gentlemen:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have carefully considered the papers filed by you on behalf of John. S. Slater, Esq., claiming an allowance in addition to that of the fee bill of 1853, for his services as Acting Attorney of the United States for the District of Montana, to which duty he had been assigned by the Judge, in accordance with the Act of 3d March, 1863, 12 Stats. 768.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General is empowered by the Statute of 2 August, 1861, 12 Stats. 285, to retain and employ counsel to assist the District Attorney. But when that office is vacant, the power does not apply.</span>
            
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of the Interior is charged by law with the supervision of matters which embrace the present claim, and accordingly I have referred the papers to him.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
