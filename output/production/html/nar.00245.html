           <span class="tei_ab">August 28, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">C. W. Hall, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney for Eastern Dist. Tennessee,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Knoxville, Tenn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In response to your inquiry of the 19th inst. covering an information from one, G. W. Rider, upon which, after a silence of two years, or longer, he demands the institution of proceedings under the Confiscation Act of 6th August, 1861, in the Courts of the United States, against certain property therein described. I have to say that I have doubt whether the Act of Congress referred to was applicable at any time under the showing made by Mr. Rider, and that in my opinion, no public object now exists which could be promoted by the proposed attempt to prosecute in the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your ob't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
