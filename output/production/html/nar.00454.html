           <span class="tei_ab">March 4, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. B. F. Wade,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">President of the Senate U. S.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the resolution of the Senate, of February 29, 1868, calling for information in relation to the case of Lucius P. Bryan, sometime under indictment in the United States Court for the District of Connecticut for the offence of robbing the mails.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply to said Resolution, I have the honor to state that, upon a careful investigation of the papers presented to me by Senator Dixon, copies of which are herewith transmitted, I deemed it my duty to direct the United States Attorney to enter a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nolle</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prosequi</span>. No previous inquiry was made of the District Attorney, as the Assistant District Attorney, who had immediate charge of
            
            
                the case, and was personally cognizant of the facts, fully certified to the correctness of the statements upon which the order was made, and recommended a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nolle</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prosequi</span>. I am not advised what course has been taken, under the order, by the District Attorney.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, very respectfully</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
