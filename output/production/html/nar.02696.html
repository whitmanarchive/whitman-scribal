            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 27, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Samuel T. Poinier, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Commissioner,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Columbia, S. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 23d instant, enclosing an account for $500, for extra services rendered at Yorkville, S. C., from Sept. 12, to Dec. 1, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Without further information I do not feel at liberty to direct the payment of the account.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I suppose that between the dates named your regular services as Commissioner were in frequent, perhaps constant, requisition, and that for such service you have received, or are entitled to, the regular fees prescribed by law. Will you inform me what are the facts?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I desire that every body who has been serviceable to the Government in the execution of the Enforcement Acts, shall receive just compensation, but at the same time I cannot go beyond that authority which the law gives me. I should be glad to have distinct information of what you are entitled to for your regular services at that time.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I observe that your earliest date is September the 12th. Is not this a mistake for October?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Please answer promptly, for I desire to dispose of all such matters before going out of office on the 10th of January.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
