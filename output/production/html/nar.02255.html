            <span class="tei_ab">D. T. Corbin, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Columbia, S. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">There are floating accusations that Mosely, one of the Deputy Marshals, is levying black mail on Ku Klux. The only specific intimation that I have received is that Judge Alden makes the charge, and thinks it can be proved by McNally, county Treasurer of Union.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Will you make an investigation of the matter, and report immediately? Be careful to ascertain whether anybody in the Marshal's office, besides Mosely, is implicated. If you discover that any criminal act has been done by the Deputy Marshal which the U. S. statutes reach, prosecute at once. It is infinitely important that the action of all Government officials in the business should be with clean hands.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
