           <span class="tei_ab">March 25, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry J. Adams, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Leavenworth, Kansas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">We have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you inquire, substantially, whether the United States Courts have jurisdiction in a class of suits indicated by you,—and ask that an opinion be given, and communicated to the District Attorney for his instruction. I have to say, in reply, that jurisdiction is a question for the Courts; the Attorney General's opinions are given, by law, only to the President and heads of Departments; and instructions to District Attorneys in particular cases are given only when such cases have arisen and are officially before us.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
