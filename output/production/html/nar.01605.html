           <span class="tei_ab">January 6, 1871.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Wm. Darlington, Esq.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Westchester, Penn.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">With respect to the case of Darlington, vs. Gray, I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">havn't​ </span></span> let you know whether I would submit it on printed argument, because I have not yet received the record, (which has not yet been printed,)—and I cannot decide until I have examined the questions involved in the case. We are desirous of disposing thus of all cases that we can, with justice to government, but there are many cases which we must argue orally.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Under the rules, you can file your own argument, and then, unless there is something in the case to prevent it, we will file ours, as soon as it is ready—and perhaps the court will take the case up during the term.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I remain, your obd't serv't.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Clement Hugh Hill,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
