            <span class="tei_ab">April 17, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. G. Palen,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chief Justice,</span>
          <span class="tei_ab">Santa Fé, New Mexico.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 8th instant, repeating the request which had been previously
            
            
            made, and declined, for leave of absence, on private business.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">The Executive Order, of which a copy has been sent you, indicates the rule that will be observed on the subject of leaves of absence. It does not seem to me that your case, especially in view of the extent of your previous absence from the Territory, will justify an exception to the rule. If you cannot attend to your private concerns without depriving the people of New Mexico of the presence and services of their Chief Justice, a resignation of the office will remove all difficulty in the case.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
