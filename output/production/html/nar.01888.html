           <span class="tei_ab">St. Louis, Mo.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 31st ult. has been received, as was your letter of the 1st ult. enclosing your acc't for the month of April.— The Judiciary funds, out of which the account is payable, having been exhausted, and the Deficiency Bill expressly providing that no money therein appropriated shall be used for the payment of Ass't. Dist. Attorneys, there is no fund now available. After the 30th of June, the appropriation for the next fiscal year can be used, and your acc't will then be settled.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. Yours,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants, </span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Ch. Clk.</span>
