            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 13, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Boston, Mass.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 7th instant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I think that the compensation which you charge for appearance for the defence in the case of Fredericks and other, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">versus</span> Dickinson, three hundred ($300) dollars, is reasonable, and accordingly have directed the payment of it.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In regard to Mr. Dickinson's bill of costs, I have misgivings about paying it out of the funds of this Department, and shall confer with the Internal Revenue Bureau on that subject. There is no difficulty in paying you, because this office retained you. But certainly it did not authorize Mr. Dickinson to become the depository of the moneys tendered in settlement of Internal Revenue cases. For the time being, he seems to have acted as a sort of Internal Revenue officer. There is nothing in the taking of such moneys germane in the duties of an Assistant Dist. Attorney.
                 
                 
                 
                
            His intentions, no doubt, were good, yet, upon principle, I much question the propriety of a District Attorney or his Assistant handling moneys tendered under such circumstances.</span>
             <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
