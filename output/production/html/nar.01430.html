           <span class="tei_ab">July 22, 1870.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">J. N. Norris, Esq.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Attorney for Illinois,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I have considered your letter of the 20th inst., addressed to the President, which has been referred to me; and also your verbal proposition to me to-day upon the same subject. You propose that the claim of the State of Illinois upon the Government of the United States, known as the Two per cent Claim shall be referred to three distinguished attorneys for their opinion thereon, one to be named by the President, one by the State, and they two to select a third.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The claim of Illinois has been fully considered by the late Attorney
                
                                 
            
                
            General, and his opinion adverse to the claim has been communicated to the Secretary of the Treasury. Seeing no reason why that opinion should not guide the Government of the United States in the matter, I decline to recommend to the President the acceptance of your proposition.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
