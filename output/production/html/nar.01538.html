            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Hughes, Denver, &amp; Peck,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorneys at Law,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gentlemen:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have caused an investigation to be made of the case of W. W. Burns, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs.</span> The United States, now before the Supreme Court, in reference to your proposition of the 23d ultimo for a compromise.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The judgment in the Court of Claims was about One hundred and one thousand dollars. According to my information the compromise proposed by you would reduce that judgment to a little below Ninety eight thousand dollars.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I understand that there is a legal question of some importance in the case. In view, then, of the importance of this question, and of the very slight reduction of the judgment, which you propose, I do not feel at liberty to accept your proposition.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
