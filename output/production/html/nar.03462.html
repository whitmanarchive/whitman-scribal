            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Roger M. Sherman, of this Department, is about to proceed south on a confidential mission from this Department, in connection with the prosecution of the frauds that have been attempted upon the Government through the applications to the Second Auditor for pay, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">etc.</span> for Bryan's Company.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is desirable that he should be accompanied and aided, in the States of North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, by Lieut. Clapp, U.S. A. You will oblige me by directing that Lieut. Clapp shall as soon as possible meet Mr. Sherman at Morganton, Burke Co., N. C., and accompany him thence upon the trip.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Sherman will start this evening. He will be delayed at Raleigh or Salem for a day or two in conference with the District Attorney of North Carolina, and will probably reach Morganton by the middle of next week.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
