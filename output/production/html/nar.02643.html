            <span class="tei_ab">New York City.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 4th instant, relative to your account against Marshal Sharpe for services rendered him in the matter of Farrell against the jailer of the Hudson County jail.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have carefully examined the records of the Department from June to October, and cannot find that the account was even received at the Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Please ask Marshal Sharpe if he can furnish me with the date of his letter transmitting the account, and also a copy of it. I will then make further investigation—but am afraid the letter has miscarried in the mail.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. J. Falls,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chief Clerk.</span>
