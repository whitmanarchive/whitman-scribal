           <span class="tei_ab">March 18, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. B. M. Boyer,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span> has received your letter of this date, in relation to the case of Col. Gilder, which was the subject of a communication of the 5th instant, from District Attorney Courtney of New York, and of our reply of the 7th instant, in which I expressed the disapprobation of the Attorney General with respect to the release of Col. Gilder upon his own recognizance, as proposed by Mr. Courtney. You inquire "whether it is intended to restrict the usual powers or discretion of" the District Attorney in that case?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to state in reply that the only matter covered by the instructions, was, that which the District Attorney had expressly submitted for the approval of the Attorney General, viz: whether Gilder should be released upon his own recognizance. It is not the usual practice of the Attorney General to exercise his power of supervision in special
            
            
            cases in derogation of the regular and ordinary discretion confided by law, with a corresponding responsibility to United States Attorneys for the several Districts. The expediency of accepting bail, the sufficiency of it, the propriety of discontinuing prosecution, and all kindred matters, belong in the first instance to the District Attorneys.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">A copy of this letter is sent to District Attorney Courtney for his information.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Respectfully,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney Gen'l.</span>
