            <span class="tei_ab">June 30, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. M. Robeson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Navy.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">By telegram received last night from Marshal Barlow of New York City, I am informed that the steamer Whiting, already libeled for a violation of the neutrality laws, is at the Navy Yard in Brooklyn. He asks that the Department of the Navy will keep the steamer there for him until she is discharged according to law. I have respectfully to request that this may be done, the steamer to remain at the Navy Yard in the legal custody of some person appointed by the Marshal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If you decide to comply with this request, will you please send orders to that effect to the Commandant of the Yard.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Sir, Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
