            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 22, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Noah Davis,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 15th instant, giving the reasons why the respective prosecutions against William O. C. Ryan and Thomas Jordan have not been pressed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your inability, after due effort, to obtain evidence sufficient to convict these parties, is of course a good reason for not having gone to trial.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I see no objection to the course which you suggest, namely, that if evidence upon which you could properly ask a jury for a verdict of conviction cannot be obtained after a reasonable
            
            
            
            
            
            effort to obtain it, you enter a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nolle</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prosequi</span> in both cases. Before taking this course you should give notice of your intention to the counsel for Spain, and to any other accessible parties who have taken an interest in promoting the prosecution. You should also exert yourself to obtain testimony in the case.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As soon as these cases shall have been finally disposed of, you will make to this Department a report of them, including a statement of the efforts to obtain testimony.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
