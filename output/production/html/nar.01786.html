           <span class="tei_ab">March 14, 1871.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Mrs. A. Burton, Grand Hotel,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">San Francisco, Cal.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Madam:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 4th instant, transmitted by Senator Cole.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">From the representations of your friends, I have a strong personal desire to accommodate you in the matter of the Jamuel Rancho. But other parties adversely interested protest against such a disposition of the case as you desire; and under these circumstances I do not feel at liberty to dismiss the appeal, and thus abandon forever a claim of the United States which many parties suppose to be good, without perfect assurance that your title is utterly unassailable in law. The slight investigation which I have been able to give to the subject has not yet satisfied me that such is the case. Should I become so satisfied, I will dismiss the appeal.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
