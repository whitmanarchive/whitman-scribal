            <span class="tei_ab">June 5, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. F. Bullitt, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Louisville, Ky</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 24th inst. relating to the case of Blanton Duncan, and which you wrote as his attorney. You are correct in the statement that the joint resolution passed by Congress is not the resolution of which a copy was enclosed in my letter to Attorney Bristow, of May 20th ult. on which the instructions contained in that letter were based, and which I then supposed to be the resolution passed;— but the resolution passed is the same as published in the Globe, a copy of which you sent me in your letter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">This resolution seems to contemplate no discontinuance of the suit, and from the debate upon it in the Senate I infer the intention was that Mr. Duncan should prosecute the suits in reference to all money in the custody of the court not paid into the Treasury of the United States;— that the property other than money should be restored to him and he should release all claims to the money paid into the Treasury and all claim for damages. I do not now see how this intention can be exactly carried out without legislation; if you can suggest to me any method, I should be pleased to have you do so.— If this cannot be done, I do not feel at liberty to make any other
                
            proposal than that contained in my letter of the 20th ultimo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
