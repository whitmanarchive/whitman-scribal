            <span class="tei_ab">March 30, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">P. Phillips, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the docket of the present term of the Supreme Court, there is No. 188, Bank of Louisiana, appellant, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. The United States—and No. 286, John C. Harris, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">et</span>. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">al</span>. appellant, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. The United States, both of which are the same case, brought up by appeal by different claimants of the same property, from the District Court of the United States for the Middle District of Alabama, in which Court it was condemned as forfeited to the United States under the Confiscation Laws. The case was tried in the District Court without a jury, although it seems, one of the claimants, at least, demanded a jury trial,— and it is sufficiently manifest that the seizure was upon land.</span>
     <span class="tei_ab">These cases must go back and be tried according to the course of the common law. Mr. Chilton is Attorney of record in the first, and Mr. Thomas Wilson in the second—but I do not know the address of Mr. Wilson, though it may be in this city.</span>       
            <span class="tei_ab">As you have sometimes appeared in the Supreme Court for Chilton, I desire to ask whether you feel authorized to do so in this case,—and, if so, whether there is any reason why it should be disposed of, on motion, next Friday?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A letter similar to this has been
                
                
            addressed to "Thomas Wilson, Esq. Washington, D. C."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
