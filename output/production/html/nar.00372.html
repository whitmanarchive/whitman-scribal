           <span class="tei_ab">December 27, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. H. T. Backus,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Tucson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Associate Justice Arizona Terr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">During the absence from this office of the Chief Clerk, Mr. Pleasants, and while I was acting in his place, your application for leave of absence from your Territory was received, bearing the date September 21. In the pressure of public business I confounded your name with that of Judge Brocchus, of New Mexico, who had been but recently appointed, and who was also afflicted with a disease of the ears. The similarity of the names and disease, with the heavy pressure of work led me into error which has but now accidentally been discovered, and which I hasten to apologize for. I deeply regret the circumstance, and am authorized by the Attorney General to say that if you will renew your application—the circumstances still being the same—he will give it favorable consideration.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">F. U. Stitt, Pardon Clerk.</span>
