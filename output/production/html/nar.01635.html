            <span class="tei_ab">January 16, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Lyman Trumbull,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chairman of the Judiciary Committee</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">When I wrote to you last week in response to the compensation of the District Attorney of Louisiana, I did not know what I have since learned, that his actual compensation under the present law is pitifully small for the character of the service required. Hence, though disliking special legislation upon such matters, I would rather that the present bill should pass than that his compensation should not be increased. Yet I much prefer that the increase should be by a general law affecting all the Districts.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
