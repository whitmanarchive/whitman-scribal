            <span class="tei_ab">January 25, 1871</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. W. Patterson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th inst. asking to be informed whether, about the 23d of January, 1866, when the steamer "Meteor" was seized at New York by the Government, for alleged violation of the Neutrality Laws, any communications relative to the vessel were received from the Spanish Minister, or other parties, and whether, about that time, any instructions were given, or caused to be given, through the Attorney General's office to the
            
                 
                            
            
            District Attorney at New York, relative to the seizure of said vessel.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply, I have to inform you that upon an examination of the files of this Department, it appears that upon the 25th of January, 1866 the Acting Secretary of State transmitted to the Attorney General a copy in translation, of a note from the Spanish Minister bearing date the 24th of that month, relative to this vessel. A copy of the note is herewith enclosed. It further appears that on the 27th of that month a translation of an additional note from the Spanish Minister upon the subject was referred to the Attorney General by the Acting Secretary of State, which at his request was returned to him, and it is not therefore in my power to furnish you with a copy thereof.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon a careful examination of the records, no instructions appear to have been issued by the Attorney Gen'l to the District Attorney relative to the vessel prior to March, 1866.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
