           <span class="tei_ab">February 26, 1870.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 21st inst., enclosing a bill of Patrick Short, the person employed by the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York as a detective in the recent Fenian movements on the frontier. I sent this bill to the U. S. Attorney, with a request for a more detailed statement of the kind and amount of service rendered by Mr. Short; and have received to day a letter from him of which I enclose a copy.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">From the statements contained in this letter it seems to me the bill of Mr. Short is reasonable in amount,
            
            
               
            
            
                
                and I am unable to see how the United States Attorney could have efficiently performed what was required of him without the employment of some such person as a detective. The bill of Mr. Short is returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
