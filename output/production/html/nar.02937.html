      <span class="tei_ab">March 4, 1871.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Hon. R. C. McCormick,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 1st instant, requesting that  time be given to Mr. Phelps, U.S. Marshal for
        Arizona to respond to the charges made against him.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">The instructions formerly issued from the Department of the Interior, and now from this
        Department, require the Marshal to make up his accounts in the proper form, and forward the
        same, with vouchers, to the first Auditor of the Treasury, within ten days of the
        termination of each term of the court. This duty has been neglected by Mr. Phelps for two
        years.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Unless there shall be a prompt and satisfactory explanation, I shall feel bound to
        recommend to the President that he be removed from office.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">You will oblige me by communicating this information to Mr. Phelps, if you know his
        present address. In coming to this determination I took into consideration no other charges
        against him.</span>
      
      <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
