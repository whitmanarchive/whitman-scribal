           <span class="tei_ab">August 3, 1869.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. C. Delano,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Commissioner Internal Revenue.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 29th ult. enclosing a copy of a letter from G. W. Jolly, complaining of the official conduct of William A. Merriweather, late Marshal of the United States for the District of Kentucky, and of James E. Stewart, U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Mississippi.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Eli H. Murray is not the Marshal of Kentucky, and the charges against Merriweather, if true, do not seem to me such as render any action against him necessary, since his removal. If, however, you  have sufficient evidence to justify bringing a suit against him, on his official bond, I should be pleased to be informed of it. I am informed that the
                
           
           President has suspended Stewart from the office of District Attorney.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will thank you at any time to communicate to this office any complaint of the official conduct of District Attorneys or Marshals, made to you by Internal Revenue officers, which seem to you to come from such a source, and to be of such a nature as to demand attention and investigation.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
