           <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 4, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Isaiah T. Williams, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Commissioner,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">No. 27 Chambers st.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 2d instant, as well as one or more former letters upon the same subject. In the pressure of business upon this Department at present, I have not had time to give a careful examination to the questions which you present.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have caused some examination to be made by an officer of this Department, who cannot discover that there is any authority for a Commissioner to imprison for contempt in refusing to testify - and also that the law does not provide for any allowance of stationary to a Commissioner for the purpose of taking down testimony—or that a commissioner
            
                
            
            
            should take down his examination in writing. He is opinion that the Act of 1842 confers upon Commissioners only the powers of local magistrates, but not their duties.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It seems to me at first glance that these conclusions are correct. If upon further examination I think otherwise, I will inform you. I am well satisfied that a Commissioner ought to have power to compel the answers of witnesses either by inflicting a summary punishment himself, or by reporting the case to a Judge of a United States Court, who should inflict such punishment. But if no such power has been given by statute, the administrators of the law must suffer the inconvenience of a want of it.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
