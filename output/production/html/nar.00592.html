            <span class="tei_ab">July 6, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Edward Jordan, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Solicitor of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In your letter of the 12th ultimo, a case, arising our of the impressment by officers of the Government of the steamer B. M. Runyan, belonging to the Alton and St. Louis Packet Company, is submitted to me for my opinion on the questions of law arising in the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I would cheerfully respond to your request if I thought I could do so with entire propriety. But the advisory function of the Attorney General upon questions of law seems to me to be restricted in the Act creating this office, (1 Stat. 93,) to requisitions of the President, and requests of the Heads of Departments, touching matters that may concern their Departments. And though he has since been charged with the supervision of other officers, and required, (1 Brightly, 884,) "at the request of the Solicitor to advise with and direct" him,— yet, as in the case of District Attorneys and others, it is only "as to the manner of conducting the suits, proceedings, and prosecutions," referred to in the Statute.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">With these views, I have thought
            
            fit to inform the Head of the Treasury Department of them, and that I would with pleasure consider the questions of law in the case, should he desire my opinion; and herewith return the papers with your letter for your convenience, should you desire to reach this office in the manner suggested.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your obedient servant</span>
            <span class="tei_ab"><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">OH Browning,​ </span><span class="tei_corr">O. H. Browning​
        
      </span></span></span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span>.</span>
