            <span class="tei_ab">April 15, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">T. H. Talbot, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have made careful inquiry in regard to the case of Albert Grant &amp; Company, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. The U. S., in which a judgment has been recovered in the Court of Claims against the U. S., and an appeal taken by them. Although I entertain very serious doubts of the legal correctness of the decision of the Court, I can entertain none of the justice of the claim, and of the duty of some Department of the Government to provide for its payment. Considering therefore the injurious consequences which might arise to the
            
            
            
            
            claimants from the long delay necessary to prosecute the appeal, and believing that if justice should be done, they must ultimately receive payment of it in some form, and through some means, I have come to the conclusion that as they have got the decision of the tribunal in their favor to which they have resorted, public duty does not require that the case should be prosecuted further. I should prefer to test the technical legal question involved, in some case which I thought had substantial merits on our side. I therefore desire that the appeal taken should be at once waived and withdrawn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
