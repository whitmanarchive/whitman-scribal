            <span class="tei_ab">Oct. 13, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. George S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to hand you herewith an original letter from the Attorney of the United States for the Southern District of New York with inclosures, relative to a certain suit recently instituted in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, to which the said District Attorney, in his official character, has been made party defendant. The nature of the suit, and the relief sought, are sufficiently set forth in the letter of the District Attorney.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Inasmuch as the records of this Department furnish no information touching the matter referred to, I will thank you to advise me of the condition of the claim of the United States against the bank at Selma, and whether or not the Treasury Department still asserts a right to the money in the Ocean National Bank referred to by the District Attorney. It will be observed that the District Attorney desires this information, and the direction of this Department as early as may be, in order that he may be prepared to answer the complaint by the 25th instant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You will therefore please do me the favor to give this matter early attention, and
            
            
            
            
            
            advise me of the views of your Department touching the subject.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Please return the enclosed papers.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
