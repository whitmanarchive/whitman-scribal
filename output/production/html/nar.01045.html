            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am instructed by the Attorney General to say, in reply to your letter of the 12th instant, in relation to case No. 334, that there is no suggestion of death on the docket, and that while he has the right to have the case dismissed unless a representative should appear, he desires to take no advantage of his right, but suggests that you had better make inquiry if any appearance is to be made, and notify this office of the result. If this be impracticable, or no reply is received, he will then make the motion under the 15th rule.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chief Clerk.</span>
