            <span class="tei_ab">October 25, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Wm. H. Seward,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have had under consideration a Memorial from a committee in behalf of the owners of the steamer Meteor, transmitted to me in your letter of the 30th of September. Immediately upon its receipt, I directed the District Attorney of New York to furnish me with a Report of the case, which Report has been received. After a careful consideration of the facts, as disclosed in the Report of the District Attorney, and the opinion of Judge Betts, who tried the case, I do not feel authorized to advise that the prayer of the memorialists should be granted, but, as at present advised, I am of opinion that the case should be allowed to proceed to final determination before the court where it is now pending.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">with great respect,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery</span>
