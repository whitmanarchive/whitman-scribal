            <span class="tei_ab">November 20, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. H. H. Wells,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Governor of Virginia,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Richmond, Va.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 16th inst. enclosing one addressed to you by Gov. Letcher, came to my hands only this morning, in consequence of my absence from the city. In reply I need only say that it is not expected that the trial of Mr. Davis will be brought on until a day during the term hereafter to be assigned, and which will permit of due notice being given to the witnesses before their attendance will be required.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
