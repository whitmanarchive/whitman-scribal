            <span class="tei_ab">November 29, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John L. Porter, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Richmond, Va.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 16th September last, to the President, having been referred to this office, I have to inform you in reply, that the proceeds of the property referred to by you as having been confiscated and duly sold and conveyed, are doubtless now in the Treasury of the United States, from which no money can be drawn except by Act of Congress. But if not in the Treasury, such proceeds would be in the exclusive control of the court, and subject to its order, and therefore if there are grounds of relief in your case which are good in law your proper course is to bring them into court.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
