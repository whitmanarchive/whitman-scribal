            <span class="tei_ab">The following is an extract from a letter upon the subject written by Mr. Attorney General Stanton on the 28th of February, 1861, to P. Della Torre, Esq., special Counsel of the United States in these cases:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">"I authorize and direct you, as special counsel of the United States to take appeals in all cases in which decisions have been made against the United States, where appeals have not been entered - and request you to see that the appeals are entered without delay, and that the transcripts are made out and forwarded to this office, to be entered in the Supreme Court."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
