            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 13, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Col. William McMichael,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D.C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The letter of Mr. William S. Price of the 5th instant, referred to the Attorney General by your endorsement of this date, has received my consideration, and I have the honor to advise you of the action taken by this Department with reference to the case of Lieut. Price, as follows:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 14th day of August the Attorney General telegraphed the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico to take charge of the defence of Lieut. Price, and on the next day addressed him a letter by mail to the same effect, containing fuller instructions. To this direction
            
            
            
            
            
            the District Attorney replied under date of Aug. 15, and a copy of his letter is herewith transmitted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of War by requesting this Department to undertake the defence of Lieut. Price, must have assumed that the act for which he stands indicted was done within the line of his military duty; and it therefore becomes the duty of the United States to see that he is properly defended—and to the extent of the means at the command of this Department, this duty will be fully discharged.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney General.</span>
