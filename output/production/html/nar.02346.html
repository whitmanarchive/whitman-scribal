            <span class="tei_ab">August 15, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">General U. S. Grant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">General:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to return herewith
            all the papers relating to certain parcels
            of land, adjoining the grounds of Watervliet
            Arsenal, State of New York, sought to be acquired
            for the United States under the authority
            of a recent Statute—which papers were transmitted
            here by the Secretary of War on the 3d
            inst. for the purpose of aiding the Attorney General
            in the investigation of the Titles held by
            the proposed grantors of the premises, with a
            view to his passing upon their validity.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The property referred to is more
            particularly described as Lots 63, 64, 65, 66, and
            south half of Lot 67, situated in the Village of 
            West Troy, formerly called Gibbonsville, in Albany
            County, New York, each of which Lots appears
            to be held by its present owner under a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">lease</span>
           
            
            <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">in</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fee</span>, subject to a rent-charge vested in a
            different proprietor. From the abstracts and
            papers submitted, I arrive at the following
            Opinion:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">1; That the proposed conveyance of
            Lot 63 from W. J. Snyder and wife, together with
            a conveyance of the rent-charge thereon, from
            Alex. McAllister and wife, will vest in the United
            States a good and valid Title in fee to said
            Lot.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">2; That the proposed conveyance of
            Lot 64, from Peter Thalimer and wife, together
            with a conveyance of the rent-charge thereon,
            from the Trustees of Union College, will vest in
            the United States a good and valid Title in fee
            to said Lot, subject to the following apparent
            incumbrance, viz: a mortgage in favor of Jonathan
            C. Wright, to which reference is made in
            a Deed of said Lot from Henry Thalimer to
            the said Peter, dated March 1, 1851. This
            mortgage is not mentioned in the search
            certified<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>by the County Clerk, which accompanies
            the papers.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">3; That the proposed conveyance of
            Lot 65 from Jane Hunter, Delia McKean, Elizabeth
            Austin, and others, together with a conveyance of
            the rent-charge thereon from Alex. McAllister
            and wife, will vest in the United States a good
            and valid Title in fee to said Lot, subject to the
            following incumbrances, viz:  an unsatisfied
            Judgment in favor of Wm. M. Bender against
            Geo. Hunter, dated July 27, 1857; and also a
            dower-estate in the rent-charge in favor of
            the wife of James Kidd, if living. The title to
            this rent is derived mediately from the said Kidd
            who, on the 1st of May, 1855, conveyed to John D.
            Livingston, by a Deed to which his wife was
            not a party; and the rent being an incorporeal
            hereditament, to which dower attaches, it accordingly
            passed to the present holder, subject to that
            incumbrance, to remove which a release from
            Kidd's wife, if living, is now required—or, if she
            
            
            is dead, sworn evidence of the fact. These remarks
            will suggest the necessity of having the
            wives of Mr. McAllister and Mr. Dunlop unite with
            them in their conveyances to the Government, of the
            rents charged on Lots 63, 65, and 67.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">4; That the proposed conveyance of
            40 feet off the south side of Lot 66, from Laura
            O. Deming, and husband, together with a conveyance
            of the rent charge thereon from the Trustees of
            Union College, will vest in the United States a
            good and valid Title in fee to the premises, subject
            to the following incumbrances, viz:  A mortgage
            from the said Laura O., and husband,
            to Andrew Alexander, dated January 7, 1861,—and
            also one from same to same, dated December 30, 1863.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">5; That the proposed conveyance of
            10 feet off the north side of Lot 66, and the south
            half of Lot 67, from Martha Davis, together with
            a conveyance of the rent-charge thereon, from
            Archibald A. Dunlop and wife, will vest in the
            United States a good and valid Title in fee to the
            premises, subject to the following incumbrance, viz:
            a mortgage from the said Martha and husband
            to David Buel and others, dated March 11, 1851.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">No Tax-Search having been furnished
            respecting either of these Lots, the foregoing Opinion
            is to be taken subject to any Liens affecting the
            same, for unpaid Taxes, that may be discovered
            on a future examination, which should be
            made before completing the purchase.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The incumbrances above pointed out
            should be satisfactorily removed and discharged
            by the proposed grantors, as also any
            Tax-Liens which may be found, before payment
            of the purchase-money for the property.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, General,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully, Yours, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
