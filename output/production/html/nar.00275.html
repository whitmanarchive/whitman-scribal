                <span class="tei_ab">November 5, 1867.</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">In the matter of G. B. Lamar's papers, it appears that they were originally brought to the seat of government in charge of the War Department, from which they were transferred to the Treasury Department, and upon a reference recently but informally made, the box containing them was unnecessarily brought to the Attorney General's Office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have just received your letter of the 1st instant, in which you enclose a copy of that of the Secretary of War <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span>. In the latter you are requested not to furnish Mr. Lamar with any of said papers, or copies thereof, without the assent of the War Department; and in the former you request me to cause General Grant's wishes in this respect to be observed in this Office.</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">As the only controversy of which I have any information turns upon the right of the Government under the circumstances to retain the papers, your request is understood as a withdrawal of the whole matter from this office; and accordingly I return herewith the box containing all the papers.</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery,</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">[Box sent with above letter to Treasury Department.]</span>
