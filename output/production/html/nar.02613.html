            <span class="tei_ab">Your letters of the 16th instant to the President and myself have been received, and both have been transmitted by him to me for such action as is proper.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Personally I should take great pleasure in advising you upon the subject of your communication; but under a long established rule, the Attorney General is not at liberty to give official opinions upon legal questions except at the call of the President or Head of a Department in matters arising in the course of administration. The reasons of this rule will readily suggest themselves to you. And hence I am unable to answer your questions; but I
            
            
            
            
            
            respectfully refer you to the District Attorney for Maryland, Mr. Sterling, who is very capable of advising you in the matter, and whose duty it is to prosecute for any violation of the criminal laws of the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
