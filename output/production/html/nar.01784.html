            <span class="tei_ab">March 11, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. R. K. Scott,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Governor,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Charleston, S. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The President has referred to me your telegram to him, of the 9th instant, in reference to disturbances in York and Chester counties in South Carolina. He has directed troops to be sent to that State. In order that the employment of them to suppress domestic violence may be strictly justified by the law, I respectfully suggest that you make a formal application to the President, setting forth that there is obstruction to the laws of South Carolina, by combinations of armed men, (or in whatever other way, if any, such obstructions are caused.)— that the Legislature cannot
                
                 
            
            be convened,— and that you need the military forces of the United States for the purpose of causing the laws to be duly executed. See Act of March 3, 1807—2 U. S. Stat., 443.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">I have no doubt that the Constitutional condition of the application from the Executive, to wit, that the Legislature cannot be convened, is fully satisfied when it is impossible to assemble the Legislature in time for the emergency.</span>           
           <span class="tei_ab">The troops will be sent at once, and these formalities can be completed by the time of their arrival.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
