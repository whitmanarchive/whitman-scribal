            <span class="tei_ab">December 11, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. Barnhart, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Independence, Iowa.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General directs me to say in reply to your letter of the 4th instant, that your case is not stated with fulness enough to be understood. No opinion from this office touches the question what course a private person should take in making his settlement with the Government. Such questions are for the party's private counsel, and not for the Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chief Clerk.</span>
