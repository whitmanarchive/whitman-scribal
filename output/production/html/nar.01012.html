            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 18th ult., addressed to Assistant Attorney General Field, has been received, but Mr. Field being absent it has devolved upon me to answer your request. Upon inquiry I learn that the number, on the Supreme Court Docket, of the case mentioned by you is 334, and that there is no probability of it being reached the present, (October,) session of the Court. It will go over to December term, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am directed by the Attorney General to say that he has no objection to your appearing for the purchaser in that case, at the purchaser's expense.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. &amp;c.</span>
