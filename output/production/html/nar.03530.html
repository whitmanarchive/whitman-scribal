            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 14, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Henry Wilson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is not in my power to furnish you any extended report of criminal cases in the U.S. courts. In a few weeks, the information will come for use in the Annual Report.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I happen to have a statement from the District Attorney of Kansas, of the convictions and sentences, at the late term of the District Court for that District, and send you a copy.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In addition to the cases I spoke of last evening, there is the case of Edwins, a defaulting clerk in Treasurer Spinner's office, who was sentenced to six month's imprisonment
            
            
            
            
            
            last year in the District of Columbia, and was pardoned, after a considerable portion of his sentence expired, upon representation of his physician that he was in the last stages of consumption, and could live but a few days.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>But it has happened, contrary to their expectations, that his life is not yet ended.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
