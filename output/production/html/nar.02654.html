            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 6, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. H. Wager, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Huntsville, Ala.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 27th ult. to Judge Swayne has been referred by him to me.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The position which I am obliged to take in regard to the Wesson case, is this: It is alleged that the indictment against him in the Alabama court is for an act properly done in the line of his military duty. If such be the case, it is proper that the U.S. Government should defend him, and I can direct the U.S. Dist Attorney to furnish the defence—but only upon the call of the War Department. It is for that Department to determine whether the act was properly done by Wesson in the line of his military duty.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon advice from that Department that such is the fact, and upon its request to furnish the proper professional assistance
              
            
            
            
            
            
             for his defence, I shall cheerfully give a direction accordingly. But the application to me must come from the Head of the Department to which the party requesting the assistance belonged.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
