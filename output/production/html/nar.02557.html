            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 4, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. Dorsheimer, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Buffalo, New York.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 2d instant, but cannot find that any such letter as the one to which you refer was written to you. I do find, however, a letter bearing date the 7th of January last, upon a similar subject, i. e., the liability of district Attorneys to account, in their emolument returns for fees received for services rendered at the request of the Head of an Executive Department. This is the only letter I can find upon this subject addressed to you by me.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">and Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
