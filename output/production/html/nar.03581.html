            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 22, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. George E. Spencer,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 21st to Mr. Williams, with its enclosure, has been referred by him to me, it probably having been addressed to him under the impression that he is now acting as Attorney General—which is not the fact, as my resignation will not take effect until the 10th of January.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The case of Mr. Wesson has been brought to my attention by several written and verbal communications.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have not yet felt at liberty to act in the matter, because it is not for me to judge whether the act for which he is indicted was done in the line of his duty as a soldier. Upon information that the War Department considers that his act was of that character, and desires<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>the law officers of the Government to assume his defence, I will direct the District Attorney to appear for him.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>And accordingly I have referred those who have previously applied to me to the Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
