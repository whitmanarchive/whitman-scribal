           <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 9, 1867.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">S. G. Courtney, Esq.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney</span>
<span class="tei_ab">New York City.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
<span class="tei_ab">In reply to your letter of the 8th inst. relative to the examination of the title of a site for the Post Office &amp; Courts in New York, I am directed by the Attorney General to say that you are at liberty to employ a competent lawyer to prepare the proper abstract of title, &amp; copies of papers &amp; documents, &amp; certify his opinion as to the validity of the title. The counsel selected will look to the Department making the purchase, for his compensation. It is hardly necessary to say that he should be one entirely familiar with matters of real property law &amp; conveyancing in New York City.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">I transmit you herewith a copy of the Regulations prepared by this Office for the convenience of those making such examinations.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, yours,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Ch. Clerk.</span>
