            <span class="tei_ab">Oct. 27, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Edwards Pierrepont,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York City.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the criminal proceedings against Mr. Jackson, of the firm of Polhaimus &amp; Jackson, and requesting me to make personal examination of the accounts and correspondence between the firm and Hodge, or cause the investigation to be made by Judge Davis or some other "fair man," before proceeding to lay the case before the Grand Jury, to the end that Mr. Jackson may be saved the disgrace of an indictment.</span>
            
            
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply, I have to say that while strongly impressed with the belief that the facts and circumstances of which the Government is in possession absolutely demand that the case shall be laid before a Grand Jury, my conviction is not such as that I am unwilling to hear what may be said on behalf of Mr. Jackson. It is impossible, however, that I should give personal attention to this matter, and I have therefore forwarded a copy of your letter to District Attorney Davis, with request that he will carefully examine such papers as you may choose to submit for his inspection, as well as all other evidence within his reach, before submitting the case to the Grand Jury. I do not doubt that Judge Davis will act in the matter with the perfect fairness, and under the influence of a sense of official duty.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
