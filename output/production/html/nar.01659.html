            <span class="tei_ab">January 24, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Hughes, Denver, &amp; Peck,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorneys at Law,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sirs:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The subject of the case of the Rothschilds against The United States in the Court of Claims, brought to my notice by your letter of December 21, 1870, has been considered—and it appears to me that the Government is precluded by the stipulation of May 27, 1867, between the Attorneys for the respective parties, approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, from raising the question of the right of the Rothschilds, as foreigners, to sue in the Court of Claims.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Learning that the principal ground upon which an appeal has been contemplated, is the supposed want of such a right, under the letter of our law, I am indisposed to suffer an appeal to be taken, and shall not do so, if a satisfactory arrangement can be made in reference to the bonds of deposit under that agreement—on which subject I should like to confer with you at an early day.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
