            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Edward Jordan,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Solicitor of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, referring to me a communication from the United States Attorney for the Territory of New Mexico, in which he solicits advice with regard to the discharge of his duties in a particular class of cases mentioned therein—and to state that after a full consideration of the subject, I conceive it to be one which may properly be left to the discretion of the Attorney himself, who, from his learning, and full familiarity with all the facts and circumstances, is presumed to be able to determine the course which should be pursued.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I return the paper herewith.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">m</span> M. Evarts</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
