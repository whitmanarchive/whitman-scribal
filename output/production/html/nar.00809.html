            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th inst. relative to the matter of the suits brought ag't you by Kimberly Brothers.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Cushing and Mr. Schley having my entire confidence, as well as your own, I concur in your suggestion that they be employed to conduct the defence of the case, in the interest of the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The compensation of these gentlemen may properly be left to be determined by the Attorney General hereafter, when the nature and extent of their services shall more plainly appear. Should this arrangement be satisfactory, I will thank you to notify me of it on the part of those gentlemen.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very resp. yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. M. Evarts,</span>
