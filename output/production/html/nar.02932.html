      <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Columbus Delano,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Interior,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter transmitting certain letters from the Commissioner of Indian
        Affairs, and <span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span> from Major John N. Craig, late U.S. Agent for the
        Cherokee Indians, on the subject of employing counsel, at the cost of the Government, to
        defend Major Craig in a suit brought against him by John B. Wright in the Supreme Court of
        the District of Columbia.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I respectfully request that I may be informed whether the Interior Department regards the
        acts for which Major Craig is sued, as done in the line of his official duty, as Agent for
        said Indians. If such be the judgment of the Department of the Interior, I shall direct the
        District Attorney for the District of Columbia to appear for the defense. But if Major Craig
        has been sued for acts not done in the line of his duty, I know no reason why the Government
        should provide counsel for him.</span>

      
      <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
