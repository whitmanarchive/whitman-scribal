John Logan has been fully informed of the charges which have been made against him, and will have every opportunity to be heard concerning them. Nothing will be done to his prejudice, without a fair and complete investigation, and I should certainly give great weight to the favorable opinion of his character which you express.</span>

            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
