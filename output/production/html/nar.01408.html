            <span class="tei_ab">Gregory Yale, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">San Francisco, Cal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your telegraphic dispatch of the 3rd ult., and also your letter of the 5th ult., together with some papers subsequently forwarded by you to the Attorney General, respecting the case of the United States, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. Olvera, claimant for Cuyammaa, have been received, and duly considered.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The decree in the District Court in that case was rendered in March, 1858, and the appeal which was afterwards taken to the Supreme Court, in behalf of the United States, was, on motion of counsel for the appellee, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_js">docketed</span> and dismissed during the last term of the latter Court, (Dec term, 1868.) A new appeal cannot now be taken, the period within which the right could be exercised having long since expired and no evidence has been furnished this office which will justify or afford a foundation for the action suggested by you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The papers mentioned above are herewith returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am sir, very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
