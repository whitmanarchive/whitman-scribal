            <span class="tei_ab">March 25, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Referring to the letter of Mr. Seward, Secretary of State, of August 14, 1868, to my predecessor, Mr. Evarts, relative to the claim of R. W. Gibbes, under the Treaty with New Granada, of Sept. 10, 1857, I desire to say that before I shall be able to pass upon the question involved, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Whether​ </span></span> that case was finally decided by the commission organized under that Treaty, it will be necessary for me to know the terms and conditions of the submission of the matter involved in that claim, to the umpire. The extracts from the Journal of the commission, which your Department has referred to me, do not show the facts connected with the submission of the case of Gibbes to the umpire.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will thank you, therefore, to frunish me with all the information in your possession on that subject.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I would suggest that the original Journal of the commission might as well be sent to this office. I will then be able to inspect it, and get such information from it as I deem necessary to the decision of the case.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Att. Gen.</span>
