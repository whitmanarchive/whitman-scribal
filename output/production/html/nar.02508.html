            <span class="tei_ab">Oct. 12, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">V. S. Lusk, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Raleigh, N. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I received your letter of the 9th instant, asking for instructions as to rendering your account for your services.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply I have to inform you that your account should be stated from the date of your entering upon the discharge of your duties, up to, and including, the 30th ultimo, at the rate of $200 per month, which was the amount fixed by the letter of the Attorney General to you of the 13th day of July last. In addition to this you were also allowed for mileage at the rate of ten cents per mile, for which you will also render your account. No allowance appears to have been made for office rent and stationary; and I presume it is contemplated that the $200 per month was to cover all expenses with the exception of those of mileage.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If you will transmit your account to me, I will see that it has the proper direction.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. J. Falls,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chief Clerk.</span>
