            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 11, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 8th instant, enclosing a dispatch No. 1176, from Mr. Dudley, U.S. Consul at Liverpool, showing that Joseph Trott, a seaman, had been shot on board the American ship "Rochester" by John Nickerson, second mate, under circumstances which apparently make the act criminal.</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">As the occurrence appears to have taken place in the river close to the dock at Liverpool, it is probable that the English authorities will have jurisdiction to try the case. Such, at least, seems to be the opinion of the consul; and accordingly Nickerson, the perpetrator, is reported to have been arrested at Queenstown, and now I suppose is in the custody of the English authorities. Under these circumstances I do not
            
            
            
            
            
            see that I can properly give any directions for a prosecution in the U.S. Courts. Should the State Department receive any information showing that the offence was committed within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Courts, I will thank you to communicate it to me.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The papers are herewith returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney Gen'l.</span>
