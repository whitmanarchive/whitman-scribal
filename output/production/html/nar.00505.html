            <span class="tei_ab">April 8, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The President.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 2d instant, the memorial of Conrad Euler, a confectioner, of Louisville, Kentucky, reached this office, from your hands, directing the usual examination and Report. The District Attorney having been called upon, has promptly reported. From his communication herewith it appears that the proceeding against Euler was not by indictment, and that the judgment is not a fine. The relief which is asked is the remission of a balance of $3,500: upon a penalty of $3,900: adjudged against Euler, on the charge of making false returns of his manufactures. This penalty, however, consists of a forfeited bond for that sum, which bond, having been given in order to keep possession of his shop, which had been seized, now stands in the place of his forfeited property.</span>
            
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">It is the practice to resort in the first instance to the statutory power of the Secretary of the Treasury for relief against purely civil judgments of penalty for revenue frauds. I therefore submit the papers in the case for such disposition as may seem to you proper.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A copy of this Report is furnished to Col. David Looney, No. 17 Broadway, New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney Gen'l.</span>
