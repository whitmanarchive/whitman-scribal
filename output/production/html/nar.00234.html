           <span class="tei_ab">August 1, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">D. T. Corbin, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Charleston, S. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In your letter of the 6th ult. the Attorney General is asked for his opinion upon a question relating to the manner of drawing talesmen, in your Judicial District. I presume there is practical occasion for a construction of the statutes cited by you, &amp; possibly of the second section of the Act of 16th August, 1856, specially provided for your locality, which may have escaped your notice.—Brightly's Digest, 845.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">But I do not perceive in what precise manner it was in your contemplation to use the Attorney General's Opinion. Whether the question shall be raised, rests with your intelligent discretion in the conduct of your causes. When decided, of course, it must be by the court. If the object is to associate the views of this office with your own, in argument, I am constrained to decline interposing.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your ob'dt servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
