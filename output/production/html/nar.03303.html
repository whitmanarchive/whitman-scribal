            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, returning for reconsideration the Opinion which I sent to the Department of the Interior on the 3d day of June last, on the subject of the application of the Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad Company for a subsidy in land, under a statement submitted to you by the Company which you believe "contains new facts touching the questions involved in said claim.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Will you do me the favor to furnish me with a copy of that statement? Without the statement, the case will stand before the Department as it stood at the previous examination of the subject, and there will be no ground upon which it can properly be reconsidered.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
