         <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 28, 1871.</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. P. Fisher, U.S. Attorney,</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">I enclose certain papers sent to this Department by Mr. J. H. H. Woodward, of Louisville, Ky.; and also the copy of a letter from him charging that certain crimes against the United States have been committed by Samuel McKee, formerly a Member of Congress from Kentucky. The charge seems to be that the crimes in question were perpetrated in Washington.</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">I therefore desire that you will look into the case, and if it appears that the allegations against McKee are well founded, that you will institute a prosecution.</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
