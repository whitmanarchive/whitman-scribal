            <span class="tei_ab">April 2, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to return to you the communication from Mr. Miner, U. S. Commissioner in Michigan, which you referred to me, and which bears the endorsement of my clerk. By inquiry, and examination of the law, I find that the adjustment of accounts of U. S. Commissioners is made, like that of the expenses of the courts, in the Department of the Interior,— and the payments are made from the Judiciary fund, which is expended
                             
                
                
                under the direction of that department. My department has no control or supervision of the Commissioners, who are officers appointed by the Courts, and I can therefore do nothing more with the subject of your communication than to give this information respecting it, which is probably all that you require.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very truly yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Z. Chandler,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Senator.</span>
