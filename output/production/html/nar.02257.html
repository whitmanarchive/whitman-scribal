            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 16, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. H. H. Wells,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Richmond, Va.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I herewith transmit an agreement between the United States, of the first part, and Albert Ordway, of the second part, in which, under certain terms and conditions, Ordway agrees to furnish granite for the new State Department Building, as well as for the proposed War and Navy Department Buildings, at the option of the government.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">This contract contains a lease from said Ordway to the United States, of his quarries known as the "James River" and "Green or Westham" quarries, in Virginia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You will examine the title of said Ordway to the quarries aforesaid, and in the event of the title
           
           
                 
                
            
            
            
            
            being found good and sufficient, you will examine the contract, and if in your opinion it contains a valid lease of the said quarries to the United States, in case of default on the contract, then you will have the said contract recorded in the proper offices in the counties in which said quarries are situated, and return the same to this Department, reporting in full your action in the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
