           <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General's Office,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">July 12, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have had under examination the abstract of title and other papers transmitted with your letter to me of the 3d of April last, respecting a piece of land at Point Reyes, California, which it is desired to purchase for the government, for the purpose of a Light House site.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assuming that the said abstract and the Report of the United States Attorney thereon, present an entirely reliable history of the ownership of the land, (and I have no doubt of the correctness of the information furnished thereby,) I am of opinion that Messrs. O. S. Shafter, J. McM. Shafter, and C. W. Howard, the proposed grantors of the premises to the United States, had, at the period referred to, a valid title to the property; and that, if nothing has since transpired affecting their title, a conveyance from them will be sufficient to vest the property in the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Among the papers is a note written in behalf of the before-named parties, in which the Attorney General is requested to suggest the appropriate phraseology for an interlineation proposed to be made in an unexecuted Deed from them to the United States, which is also with the papers.—</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">In reference to this request, I may remark that it is not the province of the Attorney General to aid in the preparation of conveyances.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The papers are returned herewith.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
