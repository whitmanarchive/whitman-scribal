      <span class="tei_ab">I have been advised by the Secretary of War, that Capt. Samuel A. Foster, Commissary of

        executed the 1st of January, 18?66, is filed
        in the 2d Comptroller's office.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to request that a copy of the same, duly certified, may be forwarded to
        me, for the purpose of suit thereon against the sureties—and also that I may be
        furnished with an official statement of his accounts.</span>
      
      <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
