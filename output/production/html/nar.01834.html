            <span class="tei_ab">April 22, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. John W. Kingman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Associate Justice,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Cheyenne, Wyoming Terr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">My dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received yours of the 18th instant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I remember you well as a schoolfellow at Exeter, and although I cannot be governed in official action by any such considerations, it will give me great pleasure if things so turn out that I can gratify an early friend consistently with official duty.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I shall be pleased to hear
            
                
            
            
            from you, and to learn how the world has gone with you since we parted at our old nursery, Exeter. I have occasionally heard of you, but never have met you. Thirty-one years must have accumulated large experience for you, as the same period has for me, and I shall always take pleasure in hearing from you, and in seeing you, if you come where I happen to be.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very truly,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman.</span>
