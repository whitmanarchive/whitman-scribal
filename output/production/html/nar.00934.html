            <span class="tei_ab">May 18, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst. enclosing a copy of a translation of a note of the 12th inst. addressed to the Department of State by Mr. Evariste LaRoche, Chargé d'Affaires of Hayti, all relating to the steamer Florida, at Chester, Pennsylvania. A copy of the translation of this note has been by me sent to the Secretary of the Treasury, that he may issue any instruction to the collector of the customs for the Revenue District within which Chester is situated, that he deems best.—Instructions relating to this steamer have already been sent by this office to the Marshal and Attorney of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The U. S. Attorney's and Marshals are instructed to receive any information that may be offered, tending to show that any viőlation of the Neutrality Laws has been committed or attempted—as well as to be attentive themselves to any matters of suspicion that may come within their knowledge,—and, whenever complaint is made against any vessel on trustworthy evidence sufficient
                
                
                    
                        
                        
            
            
            to establish before a Court of Justice probable cause to believe that such vessel is forfeitable for a violation of the Neutrality Laws, they are instructed to file a libel and detain the vessel. The propriety of your informing Mr. Laroche that he may communicate any facts within his knowledge, relating to a violation of the Neutrality Laws, directly to a U. S. Attorney, is submitted for your consideration.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
