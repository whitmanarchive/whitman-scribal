            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 27th inst. is received. No charges against your personal or official character have been made to this Department, but, on the contrary, I have every reason to believe that you have been a faithful and efficient officer. In making a selection to fill the vacancy which has occurred, many considerations have been, of course, presented to the President which it is <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">neither neither​ </span><span class="tei_corr">neither​
        
      </span></span> necessary nor proper for me to discuss, as an officer whose term has expired stands, in regard to a reäppointment, upon precisely the same footing with any other candidate, except that the value
            

            
            
            of his previous services is entitled to just weight in making the decision. I believe that this is a sufficient answer to what you ask in your letter, and with the assurance of my personal and professional regard, I am,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
