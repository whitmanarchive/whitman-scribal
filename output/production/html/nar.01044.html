            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Wm. T. Sherman,</span>

            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to transmit herewith a number of papers, all relating to an application on the part of one Wm. H. Harris for the dismissal of indictments pending ag't him in the Circuit Court for the eastern District of Tennessee. As one of the offences on which these indictments were founded was committed while Mr. Harris was acting as superintendent of the ship yard at Chattanooga, Tenn., and both are connected with frauds upon government property, in charge of your Department, I have thought it proper, before taking action on this application, to refer it to you for an expression of your views and wishes on the case. I will thank you to return the papers.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">(papers accomp.)</span>
