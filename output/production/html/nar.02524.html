            <span class="tei_ab">Oct. 21, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">C. A. Seward, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York City.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have your letter of yesterday, advising me that the case of Jones, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. Seward has been postponed at the request of the plaintiff, and asking me to notify you at what time I can probably attend and take part in the argument of the law arising on the demurrer.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The continued absence of the Attorney General, and want of information when he will probably return makes it impossible for me to say, with any degree of certainty, when I can go to New York. It is probable, however, that I could be absent from here a few days in the latter part of November—and if you can
            
            
            
            
            
            
            have the case set down for the last week of that month, I will make every possible effort to be with you, and participate in the argument of the case.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I hope you will give yourself no uneasiness upon the matter of your retainer, and promise my personal attention to it on the return of the Attorney General and Secretary of State. I regret the delay in this matter, but have no doubt that it will be paid by one or the other Department of the Government, as soon as the necessary conference can be had between the heads of those Departments.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor</span>
