            <span class="tei_ab">May 26, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Clarence A. Seward, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">P. O. Box 217, New York City.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of State has referred to this Department your letter to him of the 12th instant, in relation to the suit of George W. Jones <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs.</span> William H. Seward, late Secretary of State, for false imprisonment, now
            
            
                
            pending in the U. S. Circuit Court for the southern District of New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of State refers the matter to me under the supposition that the Act to establish the Department of Justice transfers to this Department the charge of all cases in which the United States is concerned. The proper construction of that Act is not fully settled, and I am not satisfied that its necessary effect was to dissolve the retainers of gentlemen who had been specially employed as counsel by any of the Departments in cases pending when the Act took effect. But to avoid all unnecessary questions I herewith transmit a commission to you as special assistant to the District Attorney for the Southern District of new York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The only practical question likely to arise under the retainer is, whether the compensation shall be paid out of the funds of the State Department or of this Department—and this is reserved for future inquiry.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
