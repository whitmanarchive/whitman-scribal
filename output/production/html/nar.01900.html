            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a communication from your Department, dated the 2d inst., relating to the question of the power of the President to fill the vacancy in the Consulate at Kiu-Kiang, China, occasioned by the resignation of the Consul at that place in Sept. 1867. Before considering this question, I should be pleased to have some definite information concerning the origin or establishment of this consulate, with reference to any Treaty or legislative provisions, and any agreement in regard to opening ports that may relate to this consulate, or the duties of the Consul there—and shall be greatly obliged to you if you will furnish me with the information desired.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
