            <span class="tei_ab">May 27, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Wm. Lawrence,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Belfontaine, Ohio.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 25th instant, I acknowledged the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and promised a fuller answer.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">After inquiry into the subject, I do not feel at liberty to accede to your request for the use of the name of The United States in the suit which your clients desire to bring. I understand that it is the object of the proposal suit to test the legality of what certain Departments of this Government have done, with a view to the maintenance of certain claims of private parties. Certain citizens assert that what the Government has done is valid; others assert that it is invalid. It seems to me that
            
             
            
            
            
                the Government should not appear in court as a litigant against the validity of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">its</span> own acts.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Any consideration which you may choose to submit in favor of a different action will be most respectfully weighed. But as at present advised, my mind is very clear that the above ground is correctly taken.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
