           <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. F. Chaves.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Delegate from New Mexico,</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of this day is just received, in which you state that Chief Justice Palen of New Mexico has requested you to apply to me for a leave of absence, to commence on April 10th next, and to continue for the term of three months. Upon the facts you state, I can see no objection to granting the leave of absence, and shall probably grant it when Chief Justice Palen applies to this Department for it. I prefer to receive a communication directly from him. If he has no place of abode to which to communicate with him, I would be obliged to you to inform me of the mode in which he may be addressed.</span>
          <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span> 
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar, Attorney General</span>
