            <span class="tei_ab">May 5, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. A. E. Borie,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Navy.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of two letters dated respectively May 1st and May 3d inst, the latter asking for a copy of the opinion referred to by Mr. Solicitor Bolles, in his letter of the 29th ult, namely, the opinion of Hon. Mr. Browning, Attorney General, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span>, in the case of Paymaster Caspar Schenck, communicated to the President in June last. The letter of Mr. Bolles was sent to your office, and no copy was retained.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not find in the Record Book of Opinions any such opinion as you ask for, and I do not know that the opinion desired was more particularly described in the letter of Mr. Bolles. I send, however,
            
            
            
            a copy of an opinion given by Mr. Browning to the President on June 15th last, in the case of Charles Murray, a Paymaster in the Navy, thinking that perhaps this may be the opinion desired. If not, and you will make more particular reference to the opinion wanted, I will at once send a copy of it to you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Act'g Attorney General.</span>
