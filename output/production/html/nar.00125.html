            <span class="tei_ab">Dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the docket of the Supreme Court for next winter, in the case of Jasper Strong, v. U. S., in which you are marked as counsel for plaintiff in error. It is a writ of error to the District Court of Florida. The suit was on a purser's bond.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As the case is No. 8 on the docket, and will be reached at the beginning of the term, it is desirable to know whether you expect that the plaintiff in error will be ready for argument, or will desire the case continued.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will thank you to inform me of this at your earliest convenience, as our docket of cases is now under consideration.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If you will desire the case continued, no preparation need be made by this office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
