            <span class="tei_ab">February 10, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Hughes, Denver, &amp; Peck,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Counsellors at Law   Present.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gentlemen:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The inquiry covered by your note of the 6th instant is rendered altogether hypothetical, (and, as such, out of the regular course of business in this office,) by the absence of information of such a case as is put. If the object is to elicit from the Attorney General competent and official advice, or supervisory instructions in any matter, the matter itself ought to be submitted, and a Report would, of course, be called for and received from the officials concerned, before it would be regular to consider what ought to be done about it.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney Gen'l.</span>
