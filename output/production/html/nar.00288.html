            <span class="tei_ab">This office is in receipt of your letter of the 5th inst.; and in reply I have to say that the error in the letter of instructions from this Office, of date of 31st ultimo, was purely and altogether a clerical one. It was immediately corrected, and duplicate originals were furnished to the Hon. Caleb Cushing, which, I presume, you have now received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
