            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Prout &amp; Dunton,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Rutland, Vermont.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gentlemen:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 23d ult. relating to the case of Crane ag't Walker on the docket of the Sup. Court of the U. S. for this term, Crane having been Provost Marshal for the Vermont District, and the action having been brought ag't him for a grievance sustained at his hand while, it was alleged, he was acting in that capacity. The defence of Crane was, as I have heretofore been informed by the War Department, assumed by the Government.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon examination of the record in this case, I came to the conclusion that no error had been committed in the trial of the cause, upon which a reversal could be expected,— and upon communicating this opinion to the Secretary of War, I was directed to consent to a dismissal of the writ of error, which was accordingly done.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
