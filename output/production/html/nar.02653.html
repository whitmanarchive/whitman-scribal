            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Charles Hooks,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Care of Col. James Atkins,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Atlanta, Ga.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The President has referred to me your letter to him of the 20th ult.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I had previously received your letter to me of the 18th ultimo, but did not answer it at the time, being apprehensive that any letter addressed to you from Washington would expose you to some harm at home. Your last letter shows how you may be safely addressed. Accordingly, I now write to say that the condition of affairs which you represent is receiving serious consideration here. The enormous amount of crime of that description in the Southern States makes it impossible to work every where at once. The means that Congress has furnished for this work are not sufficient for immediate
            
            
            
            
            
            operations everywhere. Unless there is a reformation in the parts which you describe, I think it will be necessary to take effective action there before long.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Keep me advised of facts, with names and details.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
