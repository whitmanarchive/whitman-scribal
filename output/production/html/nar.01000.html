            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am sorry to say that it hardly seems to me to belong to my official duty to attempt an answer to the questions in your letter of the 12th ult. The statute by which this office was established makes it the duty of the Attorney General to answer questions of law only when propounded to him by the President, or the head of some Executive Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am sorry for the scarcity of law books which you find in the Territory—but fear that it is hardly practicable to remedy it by the transmission of my views on questions to which I have not time, unless absolutely required, to give proper consideration.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
