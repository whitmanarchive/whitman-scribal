            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General desires me to say that he is expecting to see you in reference to the case of Reeves <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs.</span> The United States, and that when you spoke to him in the Court room, he had no such knowledge of the case as enabled him to make any arrangement in regard to it. As he has not seen you, he supposes that you intend to try it in its order. If you do not, he will be glad to see you about it at your earliest convenience.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The case will be No. 8 on the docket of the Court for the December term, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>

            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
