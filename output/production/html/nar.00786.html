           <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 12, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. C. Litchfield, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the <span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span> inst. relative to the case of Litchfield, vs. Richards &amp; Pomeroy, &amp;c, has been received. The time for the submission of cases on brief in the Sup. Court has elapsed. The case could not therefore be argued or submitted, unless it should be advanced. This, however, the Attorney General is not disposed to do. I have had a full conversation in regard to this case with Mr. Grant, and I said to him that this office would not agree to submit the case unless it could not be distinguished from the case of Gaines vs. Thompson, lately decided by the Sup. Court. I find however that there are points of difference between this case and the one mentioned, and that the interests of the government require that your case should be presented in the usual way.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. Hubley Ashton,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Ass't. Atty. Gen.</span>
