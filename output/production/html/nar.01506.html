           <span class="tei_ab">December 5, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon T. H. Duval,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. District Judge for the Western District of Texas,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Tyler, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 21st ultimo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is very unfortunate that the funds were not at hand for defraying the expenses of the term at Tyler. Upon inquiry, I learn that it happened in this way: Mr. Purnell, the late Marshal, had duly sent in his requisition for funds. Shortly afterwards, he was suspended, and it is not the usage of the Department here to remit moneys to a suspended officer. Mr. Allan, the newly appointed Marshal, did not take his office in time to make a requisition for, and receive, the funds—and therefore none were sent him.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I trust that Mr. Allan will make requisition at once, and relieve,
                
                
            
            
            as far as possible, the embarrassment which has thus been occasioned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
