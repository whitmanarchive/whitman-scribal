            <span class="tei_ab">Geo. C. Bates, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Salt Lake City, Utah.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received several letters
            from you on the subject of the expenses
            of the Courts of Utah in Territorial prosecutions.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In consequence of the construction
            hitherto followed by the accounting officers
            of the Treasury, I have no power to provide
            the necessary funds. I have done the
            only thing that seemed possible in the
            matter, which was to bring the subject
            to the attention of the Committees on Territories
            in the two houses of Congress, and
            to urge prompt action.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
