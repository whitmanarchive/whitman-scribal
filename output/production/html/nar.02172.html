            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 16, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">D. T. Corbin, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Yorkville, S. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 13th instant, and am obliged to you for the report of the transactions in York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You must be governed by your own judgment, formed on the spot, after conference with the military officers, and the Marshal, upon the question of extending vigorous operations into other counties. It is certainly desirable that nothing could be done which looks like faltering.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not feel quite certain that the right to be secure in one's person <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">et</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cet.</span>, as that language is used in the Constitution, is violated by an irregular and unofficial seizure.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I rather incline to the opinion that the seizures therein mentioned are those made under color of official authority. Still, I am not absolutely certain that my construction is right, and you do well to make the point.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon the right to bear arms, I
            
            
            
            
            think you are impregnable—and I think that under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments you will be able to sustain Counts for a violation of the right of free political action.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have written to you at Columbia in reference to a report of arrests. I presume the letter will be forwarded to you at Yorkville.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
