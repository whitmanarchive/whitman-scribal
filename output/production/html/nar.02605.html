            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 20, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Roger M. Sherman, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Ashville, N. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 14th inst. is received. Such is the course of the mails that it did not arrive very promptly.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am perplexed on the question of authorizing the additional expenditure which you suggest. Lieut. Clapp has been here, and is now probably at Morganton. His information upon the business, which seems to be minute, leads me to suppose that it will not be advantageous to take vigorous action, except in Tennessee. Until this is determined I cannot decide the question of expense.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I hope you will meet him. After conference with him, advise me
            
            
            
            
            again by telegraph, if possible: otherwise by mail.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
