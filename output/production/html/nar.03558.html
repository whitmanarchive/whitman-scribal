            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 18, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 13th instant, inclosing the copy of a note to you from Mr. Pallacio, Chargé d' Affaires of Mexico relative to acts of violence on inhabitants of that Republic by persons from the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The information given by Mr. Pallacio is not sufficient to enable me to determine whether it is probable that the Neutrality Laws of the United States have been violated by the parties whom he indicates.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have directed the District Attorney of Arizona to inquire into the facts, and if he shall discover that there has been any violation of said laws, to institute a prosecution against the offending parties.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman, Attorney Gen'l.</span>
