            <span class="tei_ab">March 23, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. John F. Lewis,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am precluded by the rules of the office from giving an official opinion upon the question presented in your reference of this date in regard to the publication of notices of bankruptcy in some newspapers in the Western District of Virginia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will refer you to the Act of August 8, 1846, Sec. 2, 9 U.S. Stats. p. 77; the Act of March 2, 1867, Sec. 7, 14 U.S. Stat. pp 4,—and 467; and the Bankruptcy Act of the same date, Sec. 11, 14 U.S. Stat. p. 531. I also suggest that if you should be satisfied that the matter is at the disposal of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, it might be well to inform him of the creation of the Western District of Virginia, since his last designation of newspapers in that State—and that neither of the newspapers now designated is in the new District.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
