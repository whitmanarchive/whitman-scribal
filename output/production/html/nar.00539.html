            <span class="tei_ab">May 20, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mrs. Sarah Dean,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Care M. J. Turnley &amp; Son,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Jacksonville, Ala.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Madam:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 15th instant complaining that a person named Rice, resident or doing business in Washington City, has withheld moneys drawn by him as your agent, from the officer paying pensions, within the District of Columbia, and asking the Attorney General to prosecute him for his misconduct, has been received. A previous letter of like import has heretofore been received from you, and was promptly referred to the Commissioner of Pensions.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General is not the regular prosecuting Attorney of the government, the duty of instituting criminal proceedings being devolved by law upon the District Attorney for the District in which the crime is committed; in this case Edward C. Carrington, Esq. for the District of Columbia. But cases arising in official intercourse are usually investigated by the Office or Department having charge of the branch of public business affected by the offence—and the District Attorney is accustomed to receive information of the same, and of the expediency of prosecution, from the proper officials.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your present letter, like the former, is referred to the Commissioner of Pensions, who is believed to possess facilities for bringing parties to justice who have abused the confidence of pensioners.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant A. G.</span>
