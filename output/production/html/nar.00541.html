            <span class="tei_ab">May 21, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Captain W. H. Dietz,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Kingston, Tenn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 4th instant asks a question of law of the Attorney Gen'l. He cannot with propriety answer it. His opinions are given only on the call of the President or Heads of Departments, and when furnished to them, nothing remains for the Attorney General to do in the premises,—and it would be especially improper for him to make interpretations of his own opinions for the information of private parties. I will, however, so far waive reserve, as to enclose herewith a brief extract from
            
            
            
            
            the opinion of Mr. Attorney Gen'l Stanbery addressed to the Secretary of War under date of the 7th September, 1866, on the subject of your inquiry.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your obedient serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
