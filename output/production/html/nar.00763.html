           <span class="tei_ab">February 4, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to enclose herewith for your perusal, a letter which I have just received from the U. S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania relative to the case of Arthur Ballou, and the instructions which were transmitted to the Dist. Attorney by this Office, at your request, on the 29th ult. Upon the facts stated in this communication of the Dist. Attorney, I do not feel warranted 
                
                in delaying the trial of the case referred to, beyond the present term of the Dist. Court. I shall therefore instruct him to proceed with the trial of the case during the present session of the Court.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will thank you to return, at your convenience, the enclosed communication of the District Attorney.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
