            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 23, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Edwards Pierrepont,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">No. 16 Wall street,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letters, that of the 19th, to the Solicitor General, and that of the 20th, to myself, in reference to the matter of Polhamius and Jackson, have been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I hope I was not understood in my previous letter any suspicion that your conduct had not been dictated by high professional and public principles. I surely would not knowingly direct a groundless prosecution against any person, reputable or disreputable. In this case, however, the War Department is satisfied that there is at least enough of a case to require a formal legal investigation. Should the investigation fail to show a ground for prosecution parties will of course escape molestation. If a ground for prosecution should be shown,
            
            
            
            
            there is no occasion why it should not be pressed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
