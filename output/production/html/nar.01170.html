            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. W. W. Belknap,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to transmit enclosed herewith a letter from John W. Noble, Esq., U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, dated the 19th inst. with certain papers enclosed with that letter, all relating to the Jefferson Barrack Reservation, near St. Louis, Mo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">From the report of Mr. Noble it appears that there is no suit pending in Missouri, relating to this reservation, but that there is such a suit pending in the Court of Claims in this city. If you desire this office to take any further action I will thank you to inform me. In my letter to Mr. Noble, I said that his compensation was to be determined and paid by the Secretary of War—and I have to call your attention to his bill for services, among the papers transmitted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
