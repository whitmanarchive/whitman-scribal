            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Carlisle and McPherson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorneys at Law,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sirs:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 7th inst. suggesting a dismissal of the appeal in the case of Sheldon W. Wight <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. The United States, has been referred to Assistant Attorney General Talbot. Until I receive his Report, I shall not be able to form a judgment in the matter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">This appeal was taken when the cotton cases were under a different control from the present, on the part of the United States. I presume that the officers then having the matter in charge had good reason for their action,—and I should not feel at liberty to take action in effect overruling theirs, unless in a very clear case.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not know whether your charge of perverting the law is intended to apply to them, or to the present professional representatives of the Government. If the latter, I am not aware of the existence of any facts which justify the censure which you have thought proper to communicate to me.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
          <span class="tei_ab">p 38.</span>
