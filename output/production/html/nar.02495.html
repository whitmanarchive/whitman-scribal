            <span class="tei_ab">Oct. 2, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Carlisle &amp; McPherson,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the case of Sheldon W.
                Wright <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs.</span> The United States, appealed from the Court of
                Claims, and now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">This case has been held under advisement by the Attorney General, and in his absence
                I do not feel authorized to make any disposition of it. A report upon the case has
                been made by the officer of the Department in charge of such cases, and I have no
                doubt that upon the return of the Attorney General early direction will be given in
                the matter.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">and Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
