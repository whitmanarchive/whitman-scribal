            <span class="tei_ab">March 14, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Lyman Trumbull,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chairman Judiciary Committee,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U.S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">During the late session, a bill was considered by some members of Congress, a copy of which I now enclose. It was not passed, as I am informed, because of the insufficiency of time. It has been prepared with the aid of the Chief Justice of the Court of Claims. You will discover the object of it.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Parties suing the Government for the recovery of the proceeds of cotton affirm their loyalty during the war. Papers on file in the Confederate archives show the contrary. The object is to legalise the admission of certified copies of papers in those archives. I send you certain papers, showing how important this testimony will be.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If you approve the bill, I should be very glad to have it presented to Congress, and its passage urged.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
