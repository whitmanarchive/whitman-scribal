            <span class="tei_ab">August 7, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to return herewith
            the abstract and papers transmitted with your
            letter of the 3d inst., respecting the title to a
            piece of land situated in the village of Niagara City,
            Niagara Co., N. Y., sought to be acquired 
            for Customs' purposes; and to state
            that, in my opinion, the proposed conveyance
            from Mark Banks, and wife, will vest a 
            good and valid title in the United States
            to the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In connection with this subject,
            I may remind you that among these papers
            are two instruments, which, (as well as the 
            conveyance from said parties,) should be recorded
            in the proper County, on completion
            of the purchase—viz: the satisfaction of
            mortgage from De Veaux College, dated May
            13, 1867, (marked 25,) and the quit-claim
            deed from Alice Rathbun, dated May 15,
            1867, (marked 26,)—neither of which have
            been placed on record.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Sir,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Att'y. Gen'l.</span>
