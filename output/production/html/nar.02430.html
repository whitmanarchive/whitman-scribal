            <span class="tei_ab">Aug. 14, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. H. Caldwell, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">La Grange, Geo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Yours of the 4th inst. from Louisville has been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Copies of the laws referred to were mailed to you at La Grange a few days ago. If they fail to reach you, others will be sent. Of course you will not investigate acts done before there was a law of the United States making them criminal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Congressional Committee have adjourned for the present. Its sessions will be resumed in September, when the names which you have furnished will be laid before it. There has been much more testimony before that Committee showing outrages in Georgia, than you seem to know. I suppose the reports in the newspapers have given testimony on one side much more fully than the other.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
