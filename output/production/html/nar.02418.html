            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. W. W. Dudley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Harrison, Ark.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 15th instant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not think that the villains who have been trying to inveigle you really are disposing of counterfeit money; but are simply trying to entrap you into paying them good money under the promise of sending you counterfeit money. Such things are very common, and my only advice on the subject is that you pay no attention to them.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
