            <span class="tei_ab">June 18, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">D. W. Middleton, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Clerk of the Supreme Court of The United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I thank you for your letter of the 10th inst. enclosing a transcript in error to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The United States, plaintiffs in Error, vs. Tarble</span>, in which it does not appear that the writ of error was allowed, or a citation signed, issued and served. I propose to call the attention of the U. S. Attorney for Wisconsin to these defects, and have them remedied by suing out a new writ, or obtaining the allowance of the writ already sued out—and also by having a citation issued and served. What I have to ask is, whether the transcript of the record must be sent back to your office to be kept there, or whether I can have it to send to the U. S. Attorney, to be attached to the new writ of error, if the writ of error is allowed, and then to be sent to your office again with such writ of error, and the citation annexed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General</span>
