            <span class="tei_ab">Rome, New York.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Referring to your letter of the 13th ultimo, relative to one chester F. Linkfield, who is under bail to appear at the next December term of the U. S. District Court at Galveston, to answer to two indictments against him for defrauding the Government, I have to inform you that from the Report of the District Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas in regard to this case, it seems that there are reasonable grounds for believing that Linkfield was a party to the conspiracy to defraud the Government.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The District Attorney further reports that from all he can learn of Mr. Linkfield's course, he would oppose any departure from the regular proceedings in the case. I must therefore decline to interfere in the case.</span>
                 <span class="tei_ab">Very resp'll'y,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow,</span>
