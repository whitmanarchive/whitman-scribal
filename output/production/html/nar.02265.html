            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 18, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">D. T. Corbin, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Columbia, S. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have considered your account for compensation for services at Raleigh and Yorkville.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I feel somewhat perplexed on the subject of your compensation while the sum which you have fixed would not be at all extravagant
           
                 
                
            
            
            
            between an Attorney and private clients yet it is much above the rate which the Government usually pays—and therefore if I were to allow it, both you and I might be subjected to some misconstruction.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As you have referred the matter to my decision, I will make this change;—leaving the compensation for services out of your State, at Raleigh, at the amount which you fixed, to wit, $350 for compensation, and $50 for expenses, and reducing your compensation at Yorkville to $800—making $1200 in all—a draft for which sum will be sent you from the Treasury Department in the regular course of business.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
