      <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 18, 1871.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Hon. R. C. McCormick,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Delegate from Arizona,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">You requested me to inform you if any thing should come to this office to the disadvantage
        of Mr. Phelps, the U.S. Marshal for Arizona.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Complaint is made that he is out of the District, and has not been faithful in his office.
        His accounts are in a condition which requires explanation. He was in arrears in the early
        part of the year 1869, over nine thousand dollars, and in April of that year asked for an
        additional advance, which was refused until he should account for the balance in his
        hands.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I learn that he has not so accounted.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I shall be glad to receive 
         an explanation of the
        matter.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
