            <span class="tei_ab">December 20, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Lyman Trumbull,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chairman Judiciary Committee</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">By direction of the President I send to your Committee some papers which have been presented to him as charges against Mr. L. B. Eaton, nominated as Marshal of the Western District of Tennessee. These papers are transmitted at the request of persons who wish to oppose the confirmation of Mr. Eaton,—and it is not intended by sending them to the Committee to intimate that the President has any opinion that the charges are well founded, or that Mr. Eaton or his friends cannot furnish a complete answer to them. —On the contrary they have offered to do so, and have been told that the question of the appointment is now exclusively with the Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
