            <span class="tei_ab">Aug. 11, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. S. C. Pomeroy,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In answer to the question which you put to me this morning I have the honor to say that the claim of the Central Pacific RR. Co. to lands and bonds for more than one hundred miles, was the subject of an Opinion which I transmitted to the Secretary of the Interior on the 3d day of June last; and I can have no further connection with the matter, unless the Secretary of the Interior should request a reconsideration of that Opinion.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I presume he would not make such a request unless he should be apprized of facts bearing upon the question, and not considered in the preparation of the Opinion. If such facts exist, I certainly should not object to a reconsideration of the subject, in the new light thus furnished.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
