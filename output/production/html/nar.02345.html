            <span class="tei_ab">August 16, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gen. U. S. Grant, U. S. A.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to return herewith
            the papers submitted for the consideration of the
            Attorney General, by the Secretary of War, under
            date of 5th of June last, in relation to the title
            to four lots of ground, situated in the borough
            of Lawrenceville, Alleghany Co., Pa., adjoining Alleghany
            Arsenal, and which are desired for the use
            of the Arsenal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Taking the abstract of title prepared
            by the U. S. Attorney for that District as entirely reliable, 
            I am of opinion, upon the whole, that the 
            accompanying deed of Philip Weisenberger &amp; others,
            Trustees of the German Catholic Saint Franciscus
            Beneficial Society, bearing date April 19, 1867, and vest in the United States a good and valid title to
            
            
            the premises,—subject, however, to the lien of a
            mortgage theretofore given by the said Society, to
            Samuel Keller, covering this &amp; other lands; but 
            which, it is stated, the latter is willing to release
            as to the lots referred to.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The District Attorney states that the
            plan of the lots, as laid out by the Society, is not
            recorded. This, as also a release of the said mortgage,
            should be placed on record before the conveyance
            is accepted, &amp; purchase money paid.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Sir,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
