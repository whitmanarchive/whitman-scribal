            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th of July, propounding certain questions relative to the arrest of three colored British subjects at Key West, who were passengers on board the British Schooner "Dart," for a violation of the laws of Florida, of November 22, 1829, and February 10, 1832.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I find that the case is identically the same as that passed upon by Mr. Browning, on the 5th of June, 1868,—I beg to say, therefore, that I deem it proper to suspend a consideration of this case until I am advised by you that you desire a reconsideration of the opinion of the learned Attorney General <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span>.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
