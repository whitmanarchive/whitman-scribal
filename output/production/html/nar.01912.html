            <span class="tei_ab">June 10, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of this date, with accompanying papers, all relating to the case of one P. E. Demooney, arising under the Internal Revenue laws. Demooney is charged with distilling spirits in violation of law, in Georgia—but it does not distinctly appear that any suit is pending against him. It does appear from the papers that certain proceedings in Court have been commenced against a person, not named, who is called the partner of a Demooney,—and against certain property. I understand the proposal to be, that Demooney pay the following sums of money, to wit: $48.33, as tax, 16.67 as assessed penalty, and $300, as specific penalty, amounting in all to the sum of $365, as a compromise of his personal liability in any suit pending in Court for the cause of action named in the papers, and of all claims of the U. S. ag't him for the same cause—and that this payment shall not affect the right of the U. S. to proceed ag't the partner, or ag't the property.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">With this understanding of the proposed compromise, so far as it concerns any suit now pending in Court, I recommend that
            
            
            
            it be made. The papers accompanying your letter are herewith returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. your obd't servt,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
