            <span class="tei_ab">April 7, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Columbus Delano,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Egid Etzell, of Maryland, was sentenced, January 28th, 1870, to pay a fine of $100, and costs, and to be imprisoned for six months, for selling segars in unstamped boxes. March 21st, 1870, he was pardoned by the President on condition of his paying $100 fine, and the costs of the indictment,—which he has already done, as I am informed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As he has applied to you to compromise the case of forfeiture, his property also having been informed against, I herewith enclose you the Report of A. Sterling, jr., the U. S. Attorney, relative to the matter, as I have been requested by Etzell's counsel to do so. The pardon did not include, and had no reference to the case of forfeiture, and I do not desire to express any opinion whether or not that case should be compromised.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">(enc.)</span>
