            <span class="tei_ab">March 16, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gen. Alfred Pleasanton.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of this date, transmitting copies of enclosures from Supervisor Dwyer and detective Lyman, of the Northern Dist. of Ohio. In these papers, grave charges are made against Mr. Osborn, U.S. Commissioner at Toledo, and against unnamed persons connected with the office of the U.S. Marshal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">This Department neither appoints nor removes Commissioners, and has no control over them. I have called the attention of the U.S. Dist Attorney of the Northern Dist. of Ohio to the charges against Mr. Osborn, and directed him to prosecute for extortion, if these charges seem to be well made out.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The complaints of Mr. Lyman against officers in the service of the Marshal are so indefinite that they justify no action on my part. If authentic charges of the misconduct of any Deputy Marshal are made out with sufficient specifications, such charges shall be considered, and any means which the Department has of punishing the party shall be used.</span>            
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
