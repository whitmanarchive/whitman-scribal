           <span class="tei_ab">J. N. McClanahan, Esq.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Corydon, Iowa.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">The villainies of which you inform me are common in the country. It is doubtful whether the parties really intend to circulate counterfeit money.— It is more likely to be their purpose to tempt others to pay them something for such money, and then never return the consideration. But as the persons to whom you refer seem to be acting in a method somewhat new, I will refer the matter to the officer in charge of the detective system.</span>
           <span class="tei_ab">As you request, I return to you the extract from the newspaper.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
