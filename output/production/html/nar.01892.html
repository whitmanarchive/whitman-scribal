            <span class="tei_ab">June 3, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 3d ult. with papers enclosed, relating to a proposed compromise of the case of Bochrock and Frankel, arising under the Internal Revenue laws. I enclose for your information a copy of a letter dated June 2d, inst., from the Dist. Attorney of the Eastern Dist. of Penn. to this office, explaining the condition of the case.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I doubt if the offer to pay one hundred dollars, in addition to the forfeiture of the twelve barrels of whiskey, is regarded as open by Bochrock &amp; Frankel; but if it so regarded by them, I recommend its acceptance as a compromise of the case. The papers sent with your letter are returned enclosed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
