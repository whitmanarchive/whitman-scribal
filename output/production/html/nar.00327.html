            <span class="tei_ab">November 30, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Messrs. Levien &amp; Ham,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Counsellors at Law, etc.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">73 Nassau st. New York</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gentlemen:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I enclose for your information a copy of the Attorney  General's communication of the 26th inst. addressed to the District Attorney at Brooklyn, in the case of John C.<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Braine​ </span></span>.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The copies of papers in evidence and the propositions of law which were submitted in your communication of the 29th inst. have not sufficed to change the result of an examination of the evidence which had come before this office through the District Attorney, and which was all returned with the letter to him of the 26th inst. The Attorney General instructs me, therefore, to say that under all the circumstances, he does not think proper to interfere in the prosecution, at this stage.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient serv't.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
