            <span class="tei_ab">To</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">J. D. Smith, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney, Northern Dist.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Montgomery, Ala.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Complaints have been made to the Government that improper prosecutions are being instituted in your District for violations of the law respecting the use of stamps.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You are hereby instructed (by request of the Secretary of the Treasury,) to commence no prosecutions for failure to affix stamps to instruments issued <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prior</span> to the establishment of the Collection District, &amp; that none be commenced for omissions <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">since</span> that time, unless a fraudulent intent can be clearly proved.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your attention is called to those provisions of the statute which authorize Collectors to remit penalties in cases of this kind, upon payment of the proper stamp duties, whenever it is proven to their satisfaction that the omission of the necessary stamps was without any fraudulent intent. By the Act of July 13, 1866, it is provided that an instrument issued unstamped, at a time when, &amp; in a place where, no collection District was established, may be stamped by the party who issued it, or by any party having an interest therein, at any time prior to Jan. 1, 1867,—and the legal effect of such stamp is the same as though affixed by the Collector.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">H. Stanbery,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">[A duplicate of the above was this day sent to L. V.B. Martin, U. S. Attorney, Mobile, Ala.]</span>
