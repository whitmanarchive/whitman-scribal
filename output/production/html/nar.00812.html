            <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 27, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Edward Jordan, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Solicitor of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to receive your letter of the 17th of February inst. and the accompanying papers, relating to proceedings on behalf of the United States against the Louisiana State Bank, for the proceeds of certain cotton and asking me to give such directions respecting the proceedings allowed to as I may deem expedient, or to express to you my advice as to the course to be adopted in the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I regard the subject of your letter, and the request for my advice and direction in the premises, as falling within the provision of the 10th Sect. of the Act of May 20, 1830, by which it is made the duty of the Attorney General of the U. S. at the request of the Solicitor of the Treasury, to advise and direct the said Solicitor as to the manner of conducting certain suits, proceedings &amp; prosecutions.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have accordingly made the proper  examination into the nature of the case, and the proceedings under consideration, and particularly have given that weight to the opinions and suggestions of the Hon. John A. Campbell, of New Orleans, found in one of the papers submitted to me which the distinguished ability and character of that gentleman should secure.</span>
            
            
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">I have, upon this examination concluded, and so advise, that the confiscation proposed cannot be maintained, and should not, therefore, be attempted. If I had come to an opposite conclusion as to the legal nature of the claim, on the part of the U. S. and the result of its prosecution, I should still be of opinion that it was neither the interest nor the duty of the Government, in the present state of affairs, to insist upon the forfeiture of the property in question.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I return the papers transmitted to me, &amp; advise that your action in the premises should be governed by the views which I have expressed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
