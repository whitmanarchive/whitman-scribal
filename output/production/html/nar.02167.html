            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 16, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Archibald Sterling, Jr. Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Baltimore, Md.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the suit brought in the Circuit Court of your District by John. M. Binckley, Esq. late Solicitor of Internal Revenue, against Hon. E. A. Rollins, late Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and asking for a certified copy of the Report of Mr. Binckley, as to his investigations in New York, made to the President on or about the 10th day of September, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply I have to inform you that at the request of Mr. Chandler, of counsel of Mr. Rollins, a certified
            
            
            
            
            
            copy of Mr. Binckley's Report was sent to you some days ago. I presume you intended to ask for the Report of late District Attorney Courtney of New York City upon this same subject, as Mr. Chandler informed the Solicitor General that a copy of that Report was desirable.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon a thorough examination of the files and records of this Department, no such paper can be found; and the clerk Mr. H. A. Klopfer, who made the examination will attend upon the trial.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have just learned from Mr. Chandler that the case has been postponed for a few days. Mr. Klopfer will go to Baltimore when wanted upon notice from you, and take with him the original papers asked for, in the pardon case of John D. McHenry.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
