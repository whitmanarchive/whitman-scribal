            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to state that I have received the following telegram from H. S. Fitch, U. S. Attorney for Georgia: "Atlanta, March 12, 1869. Hon. E. R. Hoar, Attorney General. I deem it my duty to report that it is currently rumored that the U. S. Marshal for this State has absconded. I have called the Court's attention to the matter. Shall I examine his bonds &amp; papers?" Signed, Henry S. Fitch, U. S. Att'y.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Inasmuch as your Department is charged with the settlement of his accounts, I deem it proper to communicate to you this information.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very resp. yours,</span>
