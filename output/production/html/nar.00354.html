           <span class="tei_ab">December 13, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mrs. Ellen A. Brodnax,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Charlie Hope, p.o.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Brunswick Co. Va.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">My dear Madam:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply beg to say that if you will furnish specific information in regard to the cases of your husband and Mr. Hicks, I will be glad to help them. There is no petition from either on file in this office,—which is a prerequisite to the consideration of a pardon case. Nor does your letter state the grounds on which citizenship is denied. The Amnesty Proclamations of the President embraced, with but a very few exceptions, the whole population of the South. Please let me hear further from you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Madam, respectfully, your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
