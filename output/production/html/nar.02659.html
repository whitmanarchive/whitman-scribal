            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 8, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Willard Hall,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wilmington, Delaware.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant enclosing a communication to the President, of the same date, in which you tender to him your resignation of the office of the District Judge of the
            
            
            
            
            
            United States for the District of Delaware.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your resignation was laid before the President to-day, and was accepted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Department regrets the loss to the country of the services of one who has so long and with so much ability and fidelity discharged the duties of such a high and responsible trust; and in accepting your resignation you have the best wishes of the President and of this Department for your future prosperity, and the hope that there may be added unto you yet many years of health and happiness.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I desire to add my own personal tribute to your worth and character as an officer of the United States—as one who has for many years worn the judicial ermine above all reproach, and with so much impartiality and faithfulness to the high trust imposed on you by the Government.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">No certificate beyond your own statement as to your age will be necessary to continue your compensation, and a copy of your letter to the President has been referred to the First Auditor of the Treasury for that purpose.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
