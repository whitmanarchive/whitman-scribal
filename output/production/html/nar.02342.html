            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply to your letter of the 2d
            ult. concerning certain land sought to be
            acquired by the United States for the purpose
            of establishing Range Lights near the mouth
            of the Maumee River, I have to inform you
            that the Opinion of the Attorney General in
            regard to the title to this property has recently
            been communicated to the proper Department,—which, I presume, will soon take measures to
            complete the purchase in accordance therewith.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Sir,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
