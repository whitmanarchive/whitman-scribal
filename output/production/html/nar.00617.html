           <span class="tei_ab">July 28, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. John M. Schofield,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to return herewith the communication of John McCarthy, late of Company K, 1st U. S. Infantry, transmitted to this office in your letter of the 23d instant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">McCarthy, it appears, was convicted before a civil court in Louisiana, of an offence cognizable by the laws of that State. As the power to grant any relief in the case belongs to the Governor of Louisiana, it is not perceived that the Attorney General has any jurisdiction or duty in the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, your obd't serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">m</span> M. Evarts,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
