            <span class="tei_ab">June 29, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th inst. relating to the Internal Revenue case of Willis Craft, of Georgia.—He proposes to pay, as a compromise, $391:33, as tax—$84:58, assessed penalty—$500: specific penalty—Total $875:91, and all costs.—In the papers accompanying your letters I find no Report from the District Attorney; but perhaps it was impracticable to obtain such a Report. I recommend an acceptance of the terms of the compromise offered.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
