            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. A. J. Creswell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Postmaster General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 30th of January last, you referred to me an account of A. B. Maynard, Esq. U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, for services in the case of The U.S. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. F. Carlisle and B. J. Davidson. On the 15th of February, 1871, C. Cochrane, Esq., Superintendent of Mail Depredations, sent me another communication on the subject, by your direction.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Within a few days, I have conferred personally with Mr. Maynard, and have informed him of the obstacle to paying the compensation which he asks. The service was rendered in the regular line of his official duty, and a compensation is proscribed for him in the Act of Congress known as the Fee bill. It is held in this Department that in such cases extra compensation is not allowable.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
