            <span class="tei_ab">Henry P. Rolfe, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Concord, N. H.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It has been represented to me by the friends of William R. Patton whom you were authorized in my letter of the 1st instant to prosecute in the State Courts of New Hampshire for forgery that a careful investigation into the facts would show the entire absence of all criminal intent in the matter
            
            
            
            
            
            of the alleged forgery. I have declined to revoke the direction hitherto given; for your letter of November 25th last states a case which ought to be prosecuted. But if authentically advised that no real cause for prosecution exists, the direction in my letter of the 1st instant would be countermanded.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I direct your attention to what is thus asserted by his friends, and desire your report upon the matter as it now appears to you after all the light you have been able to obtain upon the subject.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
