            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 27, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">George Andrews, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Knoxville, Tenn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In pursuance of the request in your letter of the 23d, I enclose a commission for Mr. Pettibone as your Assistant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have done this with some misgivings in view of the condition of the funds in charge of this Department. But the statement as to the amount of the business on hand in your District seems to justify the appointment, which, of course, is revocable at any time, if the expense should not seem to be justifiable by the increased efficiency in the disposition of business, or for any other good cause.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is not very probable that Mr. Sherman can be spared to attend your next Court. It was supposed that his visit to Knoxville would put the professional representative of the Government there so fully in possession of the facts pertaining to the cases which he investigated that his further presence would be unnecessary.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
