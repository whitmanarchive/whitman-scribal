            <span class="tei_ab">November 24, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Gen'l. P. H. Jones, Postmaster,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York City.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mrs. Clara L. Pine, No. 11 Perry street, New York, who brings excellent credentials as to her personal <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_js">worth</span> has applied to me to arrest the pending prosecution against her husband, late a clerk in your office, for embezzlement. Her appeal, by the absence of exaggerations and other commendatory circumstances, 
            
            
            
            has deeply moved my sympathies. Yet in such cases sympathy is an unsafe guide. If there is any thing in the circumstances of the case, or in the character and previous history of the young man, to entitle him to such unusual lenity, I should be glad to know it.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You will therefore confer a favor by giving me such information upon the subject as you possess, together with your opinion, if you shall have formed one, upon the propriety of any interference with the regular course of justice.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
