            <span class="tei_ab">Aug. 18, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">To the President.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to transmit the copy of a communication which the Hon. George E. Spencer, Senator from Alabama, has sent to this Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The official position of the writer
            
            
            
            is such that I feel bound to submit his letter for your consideration. I will add, however, that I am not aware of any official delinquency in the Marshal. He was appointed last year upon the strong recommendation of Mr. Warner. There is a vagueness in the present charges which somewhat impairs their force.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I feel it a duty to say that the peremptory manner in which Mr. Spencer expresses his wishes, takes away all reason for complying with them, except such as springs from their intrinsic merits.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
