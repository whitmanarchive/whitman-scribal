            <span class="tei_ab">M. L. Perkins was rejected by the Senate as United States Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, February 6, 1867. He was employed as Assistant United States Attorney for that District in the following August. No other, as far as I am informed, has ever been rejected by the Senate for any <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">office​ </span></span></span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The uniform rule in the employment of Assistant District Attorneys, is to employ only on the recommendation</span>
            
            <span class="tei_ab">of the District Attorney. In the instance of Mr. Perkins this rule was followed. He was employed upon the recommendation of S. L. Warren, the District Attorney. A copy of Mr. Warren's letter is annexed.</span>
