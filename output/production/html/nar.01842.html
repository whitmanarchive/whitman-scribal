            <span class="tei_ab">April 25, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. T. H. Duval,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Austin, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of February 13th last, though not answered at the time, was not unheeded.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The obstacle in the way of filling and keeping filled the U. S. offices in Texas with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">proper persons, have been serious</span>. I heard that Mr. Barney had resigned, but his resignation did not arrive. Lately, it has been ascertained that he transmitted it to a friend in Congress, who lost it. Upon ascertaining that fact, I made it known to the President, who has nominated Mr. C. T. Garland. He has been confirmed by the Senate, and, I hope, will be soon in commission, and will prove an efficient officer.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
