            <span class="tei_ab">This subject was referred to my Department by the President, was duly considered, and a Report thereon afterwards transmitted to him. No sufficient reasons appearing why the sale should be postponed, it will consequently be regularly proceeded with, unless some further communication be received from your Department.</span>
