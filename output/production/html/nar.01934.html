            <span class="tei_ab">June 25, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I send enclosed copies of bills for fees earned by the U. S. Consul at Naples, Italy, in taking certain depositions to be used in suits pending in the Courts of the United States for the District of Massachusetts. These are, a suit against certain kid gloves claimed by Chautard, Goodsell, &amp; Company—and suits against George W. Heard and others, to recover the value of certain importations of kid gloves from Naples. The charge on which these suits are brought, is, that the gloves were entered at Boston by means of invoices in which they were fraudulently undervalued.—The Depositions were sent by the Consul to the Department of State with his bills of fees attached. I have sent the depositions to the clerks of the District and Circuit Courts for the District of Massachusetts, and send a copy of the Consul's bills for fees to you. So far as I am able to judge, they are reasonable in amount.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
