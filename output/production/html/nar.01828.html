            <span class="tei_ab">April 20, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. C. M. Hawley, Asso. Justice,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Salt Lake City, Utah Terr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 16th ultimo, asking leave of absence, was not immediately answered, because I knew that the President had under consideration the subject of leaves of absence to Territorial officers, and would probably issue an order upon the subject soon. He has issued the order, a copy of which has been sent to you.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Controled by it, I have felt bound to decline leaves of absence to such Territorial officers as are in communication with this Department, except in rare cases. Mr. Trumbull's representation to me satisfies me that your case comes within the exception. You therefore have leave of absence from your Territory for forty days, to be taken at such time as may suit your convenience—not to extend beyond the 15th of June next.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
