            <span class="tei_ab">H. S. Fitch, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">United States Attorney</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Savannah, Geo.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am directed by the Attorney General to say, in regard to your telegram of yesterday, as to the case of the United States <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs</span>. Clark, that this office has no information in regard to said case.—</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General, believing it to be a question coming under the jurisdiction of the State Department, transmitted a copy of your telegram to Mr. Seward—and a copy of his answer is herewith enclosed. If, as Mr. Seward seems to think, it is a diplomatic question, the employment of assistant counsel will devolve upon the State Department. If the case is now pending, and further time is needed, you can easily move a postponement. This office would like to be informed in regard to the case.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">F. U. Stitt</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Chief Clerk.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">[Copy of Mr. Seward's letter enc. in above]</span>
