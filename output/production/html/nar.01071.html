            <span class="tei_ab">I herewith transmit to you the bill rendered by Mr. Phelps, of New York, for his services in attending to the case of "the Hornet." These services were wholly indispensable in doing the duty of the government in that case;—they were very valuable, and entirely satisfactory as far as he was concerned. I hope it will meet your approval, and that you will direct its payment.</span>
