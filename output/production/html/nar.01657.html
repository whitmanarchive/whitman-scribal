      <span class="tei_ab">January 24, 1871.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">T. F. Talbot, Esq.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D.C.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">In the case of the Rothschilds, vs. The United States, in the Court of Claims  the stipulation between the
        District Attorney for Virginia, approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, and the
        Rothschilds, of the 17th of May, 1867, in my judgment precludes this Government from
        honorably raising the question of the right of the Rothschilds to sue in the Court of
        Claims.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Learning that the only ground upon which an appeal to the Supreme Court has been
        suggested, is a supposed want of right in them as foreigners, so to sue, I do not feel
        authorized to allow the appeal to be taken. At the earliest opportunity I should be glad to
        confer with you in reference to some arrangement by which the technical difficulties in the
        way of disposing by a judgment in the Court of Claims of the bonds now on deposit under that
        stipulation, can be removed.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
