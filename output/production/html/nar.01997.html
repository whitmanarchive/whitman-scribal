            <span class="tei_ab">May 31, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Wm. H. H. Ambrough,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Fredericksburg, Va.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir: I have received yours of the 27th inst. It is not customary for this Department to give opinions on legal questions to private citizens. I will, however, say that your eligibility to office depends entirely upon the question whether you took any part in the insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or gave aid or comfort to the late rebellion, after having taken the official oath to support the United States, as a Judicial officer. I suppose from your account that you held a Judicial office, and took such an oath. Your participation in the rebellion is a matter upon which I am unable to pronounce an opinion</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
