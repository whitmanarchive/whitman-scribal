            <span class="tei_ab">June 28, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. W. Andrews, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Harper's Ferry, West Va</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of June 25th inst. relating to the suit of Brown, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vs.</span> Young, in which you say that, contrary to your expectation, you have now ascertained positively that you can be present at the trial of the suit. If Mr. Blackburn is willing to withdraw from the case without any charge to the United States for his retainer in it, in that event the Attorney General desires that you continue to act as Assistant counsel to Mr. Smith in the preparation and trial of the suit. It is left to you to communicate with Mr. Blackburn in this respect. The Attorney General is unwilling to pay for the services of both yourself and Mr. Blackburn, or to break his engagement to Mr. Blackburn without his consent.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Please report the result of your communication with Mr. Blackburn to this office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General</span>
