           <span class="tei_ab">February 17, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. W. W. Belknap,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of War.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully referring to a letter from the Secretary of War to the Attorney General, of October 4th last, I have to say that I requested the U. S. Attorney for Georgia to take charge of the defence of a suit named in that letter; and I suggested that the case should be removed from the State Court to a U. S. Court.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received a letter from Andrew Sloan for A. T. Ackerman, Esq. the present U. S. Attorney for Georgia, dated the 10th inst.
                
            
            
            
            with a copy of a letter  of the Clerk of the State Court to him, and of a bill of costs in said suit enclosed therewith, which papers I enclose herewith.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It appears that the clerk of the State Court, on receiving his costs, amounting to $49:<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">50</span>, will transmit to the U. S. Attorney the papers in the case, that they may be entered in the U. S. Court; and the U. S. Attorney asks to be instructed in regard to the matter. I suppose he wishes to have the costs paid.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As this suit is defended at the request of the Department of War, I send these papers to you that you may cause the bill of costs to be paid, and instruct the U. S. Attorney, if you see fit, to complete the removal of the suit from the State Court to the U. S. Court.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">(enc.)</span>
