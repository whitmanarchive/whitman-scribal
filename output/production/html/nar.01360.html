           <span class="tei_ab">June 7, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Henry A. Wise,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Richmond, Va.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your reply of the 6th to my letter of the 4th inst. in regard to the employment of counsel for the defendant in the prosecution of private James Madison, at Lynchburg, has been received. As I have already stated, my inquiries addressed to you were made at the request of the Secretary of War, to whom the contents of your letter would have been communicated—but at present he is absent from this city. I may say however, on behalf of the War Department that in case you—or, should you not be able to attend at Lynchburg, your son, John S. Wise, Esq.,—undertake the management of this defence, a reasonable compensation, founded on the basis of my letter to you of the 4th inst. will be accordingly made.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar, Attorney General.</span>
