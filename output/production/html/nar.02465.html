            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 11, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. James B. McKean, Chief Justice,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Salt Lake City, Utah.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In looking over some letters I see that yours of March 22d is not marked as
                answered, and it is probable that in the pressure of business I omitted to notice it
                at the time. I write now to say that my omission to answer it immediately was from
                no indifference to the affairs of Utah, and from no want of sympathy with you in
                your vigorous efforts to sustain the authority of the United States in your
                Territory. There is, I think, a want of further legislation. I urged it individually upon Members of
                Congress last winter—but, for some reason that I cannot comprehend, nothing
                was done.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I suggest that you make known to Members of Congress with whom you are acquainted,
                the distinct needs of your Territory in this particular, and that you do it so early
                that there will be time to carry it through during the session, in spite of the
                delays which may be produced by interest, by indifference, or by the absorption of
                members in other legislation.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
