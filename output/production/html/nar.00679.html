            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As a vacancy exists in the office of U. S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, and there is no information at the office of any person being designated to temporarily discharge its duties, a communication relative to the case of John C. Evans, sutler to the Army at Fort Arbuckle, has been addressed to the Act'g Marshal. The Attorney General has directed me to enclose a copy of this communication to you, and request that its directions may be formally carried out, whenever a District Attorney is able to make a proper disposition of the case.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. F. Peddrick,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Chief Clerk.</span>
