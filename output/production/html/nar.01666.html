           <span class="tei_ab">January 27, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. S. M. Davis,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chicago, Ill.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Some opinions have been given by this Department upon the subjects to which your letter of the 24th inst. relates.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not know that the precise question which you have in mind is considered in those opinions; but that general class of questions has received a thorough consideration and discussion. It is not, however, the usage of this Department to furnish copies of its opinions. They are considered as the immediate property of the Department to which they are addressed— which is, in this instance, the Treasury Department,—and it is for that Department to disclose the opinions or not, as it may think proper.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
            
             
            
            
            
        
    <div class="authorial_notes"><div class="authorial_note tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_note_place_left">certain official opinions.</div></div>
