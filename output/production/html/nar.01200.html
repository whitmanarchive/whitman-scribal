            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Justin S. Morrill,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Senate.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dear sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your note of February 10, 1870, is before me. I have no information whatever in regard to the necessity for Public Buildings at the places which you mention. The Committee are not perhaps aware, or it did not occur to them, in sending me the application, that all the expenditures of the U. S. Courts and the statements of accounts of District Attorneys, and Marshals, are under the control of the Department of the Interior,—and there is not, in this Department, any information or statement relating to the provisions for the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">accomodation​ </span><span class="tei_corr">accommodation​
        
      </span></span> of the Courts in the different parts of the country. I should be glad to give the Committee any aid in my power, if I had any knowledge or opinion upon the subject matter of your inquiry.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
