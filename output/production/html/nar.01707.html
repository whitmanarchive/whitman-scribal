            <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 10, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. J. A.J. Creswell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Postmaster General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a communication from H. Clay Hopkins, Post office Inspector, on the subject of a recent robbery of the post office at Easton, Penn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It appears from this communication that the Assistant District Attorney of the Eastern District of Penn. doubts whether the Courts of the U. S. have jurisdiction over
            
            
            
            
            such an offence as the stealing of postage stamps from the P. O., and has referred the agent to the State Courts.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Upon examination I am satisfied that the stealing of postage stamps belonging to the United States from a Post Office, is an offence against the laws of the United States, and that the Courts of the United States will entertain a prosecution for that offence.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I refer you to the Act of Aug. 31, 1852, Sec. 4, (10 U. S. Stat. 140,)—and with greater confidence to the Act of Feb. 5, 1867, sec 6, (14, U. S. Stat. 384,) and to the Act of March 2, 1867. (14 U. S. Stat. 557.)</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have called the attention of the District Attorney of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to these statutes, and have directed him to institute proceedings in the U. S. Court, if the offender should be detected.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
