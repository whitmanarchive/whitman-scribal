            <span class="tei_ab">Aug. 16, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. D. B. Johnson, Jr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Austin, Minn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 7th instant, accepting the Justiceship of the Supreme Court of New Mexico, and enclosing a copy of your oath.
           
            
            
            
            By reference to the 12th section of the organic Act, (9 U. S. Stat. 450-1) you will see that the oath is to be taken before the Governor, Secretary, or some Judge or Justice of the Territory. I am not aware that this Act has been repealed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The salary is fixed by the Act of June 17, 1870 at ($3000) Three thousand dollars.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Judges of the Territories divide the Territories into Judicial Districts, by an arrangement between themselves, and hence I am not able to say what counties your District includes, though I believe they are at some distance from Santa Fé.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is desirable that you should proceed as soon as possible to the Territory, as I am informed that in your District there have been one or two failures to hold the courts, and business is no doubt in arrears. I think also that upon general principles it is desirable that Territorial officers should be constantly among the people whom they serve.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
