           <span class="tei_ab">November 24, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Thomas Moonlight, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State, of Kansas, Topeka.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of November 19, inst., relating to the ratification of the 15th proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States by the State of Kansas. Your previous letter upon the same subject, which you state you addressed to me, I find no trace of on the files of this office—and so far as I know it was never received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not think it right for me to express to you any opinion upon the validity of the ratification by the State of Kansas. I have not before me a copy of the concurrent resolution—but, if I had, it would not be my official duty to consider its force and effect—and any opinion I might have would be merely personal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
