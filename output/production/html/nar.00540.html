            <span class="tei_ab">Baltimore, Md.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your name and address having been mislaid, I have not been able until this morning to furnish you with the enclosed copy of the Report of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, in the matter of Mr. Williams, prosecuted under the Revenue Laws.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">You will observe that the money paid by Mr. Williams has been actually received by other parties, and that the whole was done by regular authority of the Court. Under these circumstances, no relief is in the power of the Executive.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your obedient servant:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
