            <span class="tei_ab">May 2, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have considered your communication of the 28th June last, in which you request the advice of the Attorney General upon the proposition, submitted by the Richmond and Danville Rail Road Company, for funding the arrears of interest due prior to January 1st, 1866, on certain coupon Bonds of the Company, held by the United States in trust for the Chickasaw Indian National Fund.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It does not appear that any new security, by mortgage, or otherwise, is offered for the interest which it is proposed to fund. That interest is represented by the matured coupons, which would be surrendered and cancelled.</span>
           
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">The protection of the original mortgage might perhaps, by this new and independent arrangement, be withdrawn, and the guarantee of the State of Virginia for the payment of the coupons, as they respectively become due, be waived.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General, in compliance with the Act of March 2nd, 1867, (14 Stat. p. 497,) submitted, on the 16th day of December last, a Report to Congress, in relation to the condition of these and other Indian Trust Funds,—but although he alludes to your communication he makes no suggestions on the subject.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I consider it to be inexpedient to take any action until Congress shall have expressed its intention, and clothed you with specific authority in the premises.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The papers are returned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Sir,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully, your obedient servant</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">O. H. Browning,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interim</span>.</span>
