           <span class="tei_ab">March 31, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">His Excellency R. B. Bullock,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Governor of Georgia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I send you a copy of a statement of Mr. Wm. T. Howell, formerly special agent of the Post office Department, in Georgia, in reference to a pardon which has been solicited for George P. Ashburn.—You will see that Mr. Howell states that Ashburn has been ill-treated by the keepers who have him in charge in the Georgia Penitentiary, on account of his political principles.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Though I have not felt at liberty to recommend the pardon of Ashburn, I feel bound to bring to your notice such a statement as is thus incidentally made; because I know that you will be disposed to protect this young man against any imposition from his keepers.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
