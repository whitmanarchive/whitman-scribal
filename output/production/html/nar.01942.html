            <span class="tei_ab">June 29, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Treasury.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 28th inst., with accompanying papers, all relating to the case of August Grages, arising under the Internal Revenue laws. Grages proposes to stamp the cigars, and pay $100 as specific penalty. It does not appear that any suit or proceeding in court has been commenced; but it does appear that the Collector was at one time instructed by the Commissioner "to lay the matter before the District Attorney."—Whether he has done so or not, is unknown to me. On the papers submitted, I have no right to make any recommendation in the case, but as it has been referred to this office, I have to say that the compromise proposed seems to me a proper one.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to be,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
