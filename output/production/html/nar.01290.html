      <span class="tei_ab">April 2, 1870.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Hon. E. C. Banfield,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Solicitor of the Treasury.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to send herewith a letter to me from the United States Attorney for
        Vermont, relating to a recognizance of Evelyn P. Mussey, and sureties, he having been
        indicted for robbing the Post Office, in which indictment a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nolle</span>
        <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prosequi</span> has been entered.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">It appears that Isaac McDaniel, surety on the recognizance, is deceased, and the
        recognizance has already been presented as a claim in behalf of the United States, before
        the Commissioners of Probate of his estate, and has been allowed.</span>
      
      
      <span class="tei_ab">As it appears that, under all the circumstances, it was not thought advisable to prosecute
        Mussey, it does not seem to me that the penalty of the recognizance should be enforced,
      —but I have no authority to discharge it,—and it can only be compromised, I
        suppose, as a claim, under the 10th section of the Act of March 3, 1863.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">If I may be permitted to express an opinion, I think this claim should be compromised by
        receiving, in discharge thereof, the costs of the suit on recognizance, if any has been
        brought, and of the proceedings in proving the claim before the Commissioners.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
