            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 28. 1871,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John A. Minnis, Esq., U.S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Montgomery, Ala.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received yours of the 23d instant, enclosing a copy of Judge Busteed's charge.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">What is your impression of the extent of the Ku Klux organization in Northern Alabama, and also in the Middle District? Will you give me your opinion upon the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">desireableness​ </span></span> of associate counsel for the Government in the prosecution of those cases? Will you also inform me for what compensation such assistance could probably be obtained? and also indicate the individual whom you would prefer—or, at least, several, out of whom a selection could be made in each District? I am not at all certain that I shall be able to engage the assistance, even if it should be found desirable, because our funds are very limited. Yet this information may be valuable to me, in case it should become possible to aid you in that way.</span>     
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
