            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 28, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. John A. Bingham,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Chairman of Judiciary Committee,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to transmit herewith the following papers:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">First</span>—The copy of a letter to myself from Judge Erskine, U.S. District Judge in Georgia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Second</span>—A draft prepared by Judge Erskine, of a bill to take away the Circuit jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Georgia—to create a Circuit Court in said District,—and for other purposes.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Third</span>—the copy of a statement from the Clerk of the U.S. Courts in the Southern District of Georgia, showing the amount of business in that District.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Fourth</span>—A similar statement from the Clerk of the Court in the Northern District.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">These papers will explain themselves.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is the wish of Judge Erskine that the subject shall be laid before your Committee, and that if his bill is approved it shall be submitted to the House.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I know that the insufficiency of the judicial force of the United States in Georgia is a subject of great complaint among members of the bar. There is really far more business
            
            
            
            
            
            of a civil nature alone than one industrious and able Judge, such as we now have, can keep up with—to say nothing of the large amount of criminal business.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">No doubt the Members of your House from Georgia will be able to give you additional information on the subject, if it is desired.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The present law, which denies to the Northern District the benefit of a Circuit Judge, is that of August 11, 1848. See Sec. 8, 9 U.S. Stats. 281.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
