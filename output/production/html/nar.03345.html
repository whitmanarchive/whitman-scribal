            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 14, 1871</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John Potts, Esq. Chief Clerk</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">War Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 13th instant, transmitting a communication addressed to the Secretary of War by Thomas W. Price, of Philadelphia, under date of the 11th inst. relative to the case of his son Lieut. Price, who is under arrest at Santa Fé, New Mexico, on a charge of murder. You request that such speedy action as is practicable may be had in the case of Lieut. Price.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In reply I have to inform you that on the 14th ultimo, the Attorney of the U.S. for New Mexico was both telegraphed and written to in reference to this case, and requested to use all means at his command to bring the case to an early determination—to which the Dist. Attorney replied on the 15th that he would undertake the defence of Lieut. Price; and I have no doubt that he will use every exertion, and vigorously press it to a conclusion.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
