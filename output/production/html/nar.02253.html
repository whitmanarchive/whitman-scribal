            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 15, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Richard Crowley, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Lockport, N. Y.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The War Department has returned the account of Wm Hildreth for $96.90, for pay and expense in the investigation of the matter of Edward S. Rowland for horse-claim, with the statement that there is an appropriation under the control of that Department out of which it would be proper to pay this account.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Although you were informed in my letter of the 23rd of November last that I did not intend to authorize you to subject the Government to expense in the inquiry directed in my letter of August 30th last, I feel bound under the peculiar facts of the case, and the probable good faith of Mr. Hildreth's services, to make an effort to compensate him reasonably.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">There is an appropriation for the detection of crimes which covers such expenditures when authorized, or recognized—but unfortunately the present appropriation is nearly or
           
           
             
             
            
            
            
            quite exhausted. But it is possible that Congress may add to it in a deficiency bill,—and therefore I return the account to Mr. Hildreth in order that it may be made out against this Department, and carefully examined and approved by you, and receipted by him.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If it would appear reasonable I would feel disposed to pay it, if any fund appropriated for such objects should be in hand.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I must say that the account now presented seems very extravagant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
