            <span class="tei_ab">June 23, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Coles Bashford,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In your communication of the 17th, you state that no Attorney of the United States is on duty in the Territory of Arizona. Our records show that John A. Rush is the Attorney for that Territory. He has been called upon by letter of this date to report whether he is at his post and engaged in his official duties. No action can be had in this case of Neville until an Attorney of the United States shall have reported himself.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully, your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
