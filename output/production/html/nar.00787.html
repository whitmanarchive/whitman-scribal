S., if the Government will dismiss its appeal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have considered the finding of facts and the recommendation of the Ass't. Atty. Gen'l. in charge of cases in the Court of Claims, &amp; concur with him in opinion, that the case may properly be dismissed. I will thank you to advise me whether your Dept. will acquiesce in this suggestion.</span>
