            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the Circular issued by authority of the joint select Committee on Retrenchment, dated January 20th, 1868, covering thirty seven questions relating to the condition of the civil service.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">As the Assistant Attorney Gen'l has received and answered the same circular, and as his answer contains all the information sought for, relating to this Office, I take it for granted that no further reply is desired from me.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Respectfully, Sir,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
