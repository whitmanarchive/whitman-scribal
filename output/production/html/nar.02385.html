            <span class="tei_ab">July 31, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Wm. Ellis.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Houston, Miss.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 28th instant.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is not customary for the Attorney General to give opinions on legal questions at the call of private citizens. But I will depart from the rule so far as to say to you that the holding of an office, and the taking of an oath prior to the rebellion, does not disqualify a man for office now, unless after having taken such an oath he engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or gave aid and comfort to the enemies thereof.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Whether your acts amounted to such insurrection, rebellion, aid or comfort, I cannot undertake to decide.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
