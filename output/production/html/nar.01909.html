            <span class="tei_ab">June 9, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Hamilton Fish,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of State.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The U. S. Dist. Attorney for the Southern Dist. of New York wishes to use in the case of the Dupuy pardons, a certificate from your Department whether those pardons still remain in your Department, as originally issued, or whether the same have been actually cancelled. I understand that no cancellation of the pardons has been made, but that they remain on file, with the order of the President, revoking the same, attached or enclosed.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Will you have the kindness to furnish me with a certificate of this fact—if the fact be so—with an attested copy of the paper enclosed, so that I can transmit them to the Dist. Attorney at New York?</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp, your obd't servt,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
