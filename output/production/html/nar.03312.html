            <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 5, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Columbus Delano,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Interior.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The letter of Mr. Nichols to you, under date of August 25, 1871 asking for a re-hearing upon the application of the Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad Company, for leave to file its map, and to be recognized as entitled to lands, &amp;c., shows him to be entirely mistaken as to the amount of attention
            
                
            
            
            
            which the subject received in this Office, during the preparation of the Opinion which was sent to you on the 3d day of June last. In support of the application I heard Mr. Nichols two hours on one day, Judge Hoar one hour on another day, and another hour on a third day. I also read and carefully weighed the following papers:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">1. Printed affidavit of R. M. Poemeroy.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">2. Printed affidavit of Effingham H. Nichols.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">3. Letter of Hon. James Harlan.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">4. Letter of Hon. Wm. A. Wheeler.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">5. Statement of Messrs. William Claplin and others.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">6. Opinion of Hon. Benjn. R. Curtis.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">7. Opinion of Hon. E. R. Hoar.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">8. Argument of Mr. Nichols before Secretary Delano.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">9. Argument of Hon. Wm. M. Evarts before Secretary Cox.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">10. Letter from Mr. Nichols to Secretary Delano.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">11. Letter from Mr. Evarts to Secretary Delano.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">12. Another letter from Mr. Nichols to Secretary Delano.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">13. Extracts from speeches of Senators, and letters from Senators and Representatives.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">14. Affidavits of Messrs. Nichols, Wetmore and others.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">15. Letter of Mr. Nichols to myself.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The statutes bearing on the subject were of course thoroughly examined.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Though I entered upon the investigation with strong personal sympathies in favor of the Company, I was unable to advise that its application was well found in law.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The company is dissatisfied with my opinion, and asks a rehearing. About two months ago, I expressed a willingness to hear further argument on any material facts not considered in the former examination of the subject. I still have that willingness. But owing to the near approach of the season when other business will press heavily
                 
            
                
                
                
            on this Department, I desire to make an early disposition of the subject; and I now say to you that I am willing to hear counsel for the company on such facts, at any time this week; and if it will be more convenient for the counsel to make the argument in New York, I will hear it there, upon sufficient notice of the time by mail or telegraph.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will hear them for six hours, if they desire to speak so long, provided that the whole argument can be made at one audience.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
