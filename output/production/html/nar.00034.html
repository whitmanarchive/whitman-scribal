            <span class="tei_ab">August 14, 1865.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. Matthew Hopkins,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Austin, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of the Interior has referred to this Department your letter of the 7th July. I am glad to learn that the records of the Federal Court for the Western District of Texas are in your hands. It is needless for me to suggest to you the propriety and importance of their being carefully preserved. Whether you still hold the office of clerk, or not, is a judicial question about which it would be useless, if not improper, for me to express an opinion.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, sir, yours respectfully</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">James Speed</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General</span>
