           <span class="tei_ab">July 27, 1869.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. G. W. Scofield,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Warren, Penn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received repeated complaints from the Territory of Dakota, that Mr. Warren Cowles does not appear there to attend to the duties of the office of District Attorney, and that the public interests have been suffering by reason of his failure. I should be glad to know where he is, and why he does not go to the Territory, so that I may be able to determine whether it is necessary or proper to revoke his appointment. I supposed at the time he was appointed that he would be ready to enter at once upon the duties of the office for which he was an applicant—and as the incumbent was suspended to make room for him, the expectation would not seem to be unreasonable. As I have not the address of Mr. Cowles, I have communicated with you in the hope that you would be able to inform him of the complaints that exist, and enable me to learn what is the matter.</span>
   
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E. R. Hoar,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
