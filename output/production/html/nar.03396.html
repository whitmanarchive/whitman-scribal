            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to enclose herewith a letter addressed to this Department, under date of the 10th instant, by S. T. Carrow, Esq. Marshal of the U.S. for the District of North Carolina, asking to be furnished with a complete set of the Statutes at Large for the use of his office.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">If it is in your power to comply with the wishes of the Marshal in the premises, I would be obliged if you would do so. As stated by the Marshal, it is difficult to transact his business without the aid of the laws of the U.S. bearing upon his duties.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.</span>
