            <span class="tei_ab">Dec. 20, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">George C. Bates, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Salt Lake City, U.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 10th inst. is received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have answered by telegraph that you are at liberty to employ Mr. Baskin, and I herewith enclose a commission for him.</span>
            
            
            
            
            <span class="tei_ab">Under the circumstances I do not feel at liberty to employ other additional counsel. The Government ought not to show any unseemly zeal to convict Brigham Young, and the addition of two lawyers to the regular professional force of the Government in Utah might have that appearance. The propriety of the employment of Mr. Baskin is obvious, he having prepared the cases.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In answer to your other letter of the same date, I have to say that it seems to me wrong in principle to covenant with regard to bail while the accused is absconding. When a man submits himself to the law, it is time enough to consider what amenities he may receive under the law. Should Mr. Young be arrested, the question of bail will be altogether a judicial one, to be decided by the court upon the principles which would operate in the case of any other accused party.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
