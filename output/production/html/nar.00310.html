            <span class="tei_ab">November 21, 1867.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">D. J. Baldwin, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Houston, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Attorney General has received your report of the 12th inst. informing him that in January 1866,
                sundry Americans, acting in the manner of a hostile expedition against Mexico committed murders,
                outrages and depredations, upon the persons and property of the inhabitants of Bagdad, on the Mexican
                side of the Rio Grande, and that indictments were found at the last March term of the U. S. Court at
                Brownsville, Texas,— that no arrests have been made, and that the leader of the foray is one R.
                Clay Crawford, of Pennsylvania.—You add that "the dignity of the American name requires that
                something be done to bring the arch offenders to justice."</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The object of your communication is not distinctly apprehended.—Such of the offenders as are
                within reach should, of course, be brought to trial. Such as are beyond the local jurisdiction should be
                pursued and brought to trial by the methods provided by law. In cases where a person indicted in one
                District makes his escape into another, a copy of the indictment, authenticated by the certificate of
                the clerk and the seal of the Court, together with evidence of identity, would justify any Judge,
                Commissioner, or Magistrate in committing the fugitive and removing him to the proper jurisdiction, under
                Sec. 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789. See Conkling's Treatise 582.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
