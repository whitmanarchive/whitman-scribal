           <span class="tei_ab">Sept. 26, 1866.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">To</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Wm. A. Dart, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Dist. Attorney, Potsdam, N. Y.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">On the 4th of June last, Mr. Williams, Dep. U. S. Marshal at Buffalo, called upon Gen. Barry, commanding at that point, for a military force to seize certain boxes of arms &amp; accoutrements then in the  possession of the American Express Company. A military force was detailed accordingly to act as a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">posse</span> in aid of the Marshal—and 20 cases, marked P. O. Day, and 2 cases marked Dr. Donnelley, Buffalo, New York, were seized and stored in Fort Porter, Buffalo, for safe keeping—where they still remain.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of War has ordered Maj. Gen. Barry to deliver these cases to such person or officer as should be designated to receive them by the Attorney General.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have today endorsed on the same paper which contains a schedule of the property, &amp; the order of the Secretary of War, an order requesting the delivery of the property to the American Express Company.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I enclose herewith the paper referred to with both the orders endorsed thereon, &amp; authorize you to deliver the same to the said Express Company, or their authorized agent, upon the execution &amp; delivery to you of a Bond to be executed to the United States by responsible obligors (to be approved as such by the Dist. Judge of the United States at Buffalo) in a penal sum equal to double the
            
            
            
            value of the property, upon condition that it shall not be used for any unlawful purpose.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Henry Stanbery</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
