            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Peter M. Dox,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your reference of the 8th instant, of an account against the United States of Messrs. Ellis &amp; Caldwell, attorneys at law, Jacksonville, Ala., has been considered.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It appears that Mr. Caldwell, of that firm, rendered assistance in a criminal prosecution against a person charged with violating the postage laws of the United States.—This service was apparently rendered at the instance of Mr. Southworth, a special agent of the Post Office Department. As it was not rendered at the request of this Department, I do not feel authorized, under existing laws, to pay for it out of any funds under my control. This I regret, for the service seems to have been useful, and to have been well worth the compensation charged.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
