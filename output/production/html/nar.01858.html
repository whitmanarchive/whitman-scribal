            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of Utah Territory,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Salt Lake City.</span>

            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter without date received in February last, requesting my opinion upon the right of Governor Vaughan to grant a pardon, after his successor had received a commission and taken the oath, but had not arrived in the Territory, or entered upon the duties of the office, has not been answered.</span>
         <span class="tei_ab">This omission was not from any disrespect to you, but because it is the usage of this office to give no opinions upon such questions except at the call of the President or Secretary of State, unless an opinion is necessary in the course of instruction to a District Attorney, or Marshal.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
