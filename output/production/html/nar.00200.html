           <span class="tei_ab">January 29, 1867.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Benj. Price, Esq.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Assistant Dist. Attorney,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Baltimore, Md.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
<span class="tei_ab">The Solicitor of the Treasury has referred to this office your letter of the 12th inst. relative to the case of John Morgan, Jr. held for trial by the State authorities for offences against the Laws of the United States.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">In the absence of all power in the matter, the Attorney General has no instructions to give you—but suggests that it might be well to call the attention of the Judiciary Committees of Congress, to the necessity of giving exclusive jurisdiction in like cases to the Courts of the United States.</span>
<span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, yours,</span>
<span class="tei_ab">M. F. Pleasants, Ch. Cl'k.</span>
