            <span class="tei_ab">February 8, 1868.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Mr. William Kelley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">E street, near Virginia av. Island.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">In response to your letter of the 7th, to the Attorney General, in relation to your private interests, as the tenant or occupant of a Lot of ground in the city of Washington, as affected by a suit which you say has been instituted in the Courts of the District of Columbia, you are informed that your rights in the premises, like those of other citizens, are such as the law secures you, and that when they are drawn in question, the magistrate and Judges
            
            are bound to decide on them. If your interests are already involved in litigation the Court, and not the Executive offices, is the place to defend them. If counsel are necessary, you must expect to employ your own lawyer.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient servant,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney Gen'l.</span>
