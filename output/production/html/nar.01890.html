Harris proposes to pay nine thousand one hundred and eighty seven dollars, and fifty-three cents, as a tax upon fine cut chewing tobacco, and upon smoking tobacco—in reference to which his returns have been found to be deficient—and to pay, also, all costs of court, and all expenses incurred in the seizure and custody of his property, which, it is supposed, has been proceeded against as forfeited to the United States,— and that these amounts shall be received in full settlement of all claims and suits arising out of this deficiency in his returns.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Having examined the case as it appears <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">in the papers in the papers​ </span><span class="tei_corr">in the papers​

            <span class="tei_ab">Very Resp. &amp;c. &amp;c.</span>
