            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The Secretary of the Treasury has informed me that last winter or spring certain papers relating to a lot of land at Castine, Maine, which Mr. C. J. Abbott proposed to sell to the Government were sent to you in order to procure the execution of the papers necessary to pass the title; that on the 25th of May your attention was particularly called to the importance of early action in the matter; that upon the 18th of September you were again addressed upon that subject by the Treasury Department; and that no reply to these communications has been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It is desirable that you should at once attend to this matter, and explain your failure to do so before.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
