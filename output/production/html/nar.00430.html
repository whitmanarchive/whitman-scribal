            <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to return herewith the papers in the matter of the claim of Wm. H. Scanlon, received under cover of your letter of the 3d of December last—and to advise you that the Attorney General has, under date of February 4, given an opinion in a similar case, which was submitted to him from the War Department, known as the claim of Messrs. Bott &amp; Davis, for the loss of a barge, and which presented a similar point. You are accordingly referred to that opinion, as fully covering the question of Mr. Scanlon's claim.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I am, Sir, very Respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">John M. Binckley,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Assistant Attorney General.</span>
