            <span class="tei_ab">Savannah, Georgia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letters of the 29th ultimo, asking for compensation for services alleged to have been rendered for the Government in the criminal prosecutions, in the Southern District of Georgia, against Foster Blodgett and Charles H. Hopkins.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Before the claim can be considered it is necessary that I should have positive information that you
                 
            
                
            were retained under the authority of the Government. You state that Mr. Fitch, District Attorney, informs you that he had received authority from Washington to retain you. You do not state from what Department such alleged authority issued. I will thank you to ascertain what Department it was, and the date of the authority, so that an investigation may be made into the recorded correspondence of that Department.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
