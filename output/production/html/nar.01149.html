            <span class="tei_ab">January 8, 1870.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. C. Delano,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Commissioner Internal Revenue.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I enclose herewith the bill of Albert E. Cochran, for services in reporting stenographically a decision of Judge Blatchford of New York in the case of the United States vs. DuPuy. Mr. Cochran was employed by the U. S. Attorney for this purpose. The decision reported was in reference to the validity of a conditional pardon granted to the defendant by the late President of the United States. I think the bill reasonable in amount, and the case such as justified the employment of a reporter. The account was sent by me to the Secretary of the Interior with the request that it be paid out of the Judiciary fund, but was returned with the information that the Secretary had no authority to pay it from that fund. As the case arose under the Internal Revenue laws, I respectfully recommend that the bill be paid from the fund under your control.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully yours,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">W. A. Field,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Acting Attorney General.</span>
