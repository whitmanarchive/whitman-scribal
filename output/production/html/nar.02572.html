            <span class="tei_ab">Nov. 10, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">R. M. Sherman, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D. C.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Fort Bliss, Texas.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I desire that you will proceed to the States of North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, and there investigate the alleged attempts at fraud, successful or otherwise, in the presentation of claims through the 2d Auditors office. You will confer with the
             
                
            District Attorneys in those States respectively. You will put them in possession of all information which you now have, or may obtain, that will be useful to them in instituting and conducting prosecutions against the offenders. You will visit neighborhoods where you have reason to believe that material facts may be ascertained, or material testimony may be found.</span>
                 <span class="tei_ab">Your necessary traveling expenses upon this trip will be paid by this Department, and the Chief Clerk will be directed to furnish you with a reasonable advance.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">From the nature of the business the extent of the trip must be left, in a great measure, to yourself. Unless you receive future instructions, you will be guided by circumstances and developments, protracting the journey no longer than is necessary for the accomplishment of the object.</span>
                <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
