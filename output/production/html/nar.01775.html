            <span class="tei_ab">March 13, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Charles L. Woodbury, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">My dear Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have delayed answering yours of the 4th, in the hope that I might be able to send a satisfactory answer by this time. From present appearances, the Court would not grant a motion to advance your case.— They have refused one such request, and have intimated that I have exhausted their indulgence in this particular by a large number of such requests, which they have granted.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Appearances are now that No. 187 will not be reached, this term. If, when you come, I find that I can accommodate you, I shall take great pleasure in doing so—but I cannot promise it now. Hoping to have the pleasure of seeing you, I am,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">yours very truly,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman.</span>
