            <span class="tei_ab">I send you a draft of a bill which has been prepared to avoid difficulties growing out of a recent decision of the Court of Claims. The object of it is to make papers in the Confederate archives now in the possession of this Government evidence to establish the disloyalty of suitors in the Court of Claims. It has been submitted to the Chief Justice of that court, and I am informed has his approval. I respectfully commend it to the consideration of your committee, and urge the passage of it, or of some similar measure.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully, &amp;c</span>
