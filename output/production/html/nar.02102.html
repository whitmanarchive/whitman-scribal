            <span class="tei_ab">Oct. 28, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Noah Davis,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">U. S. Attorney,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">New York.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Referring to your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the suit in the Supreme Court of your State by the Ocean National Bank against the Receiver of the First National Bank of Selma, Alabama, yourself and others, I have to say that it cannot be conceded that the United States may be brought
       
            
            
            
            into court as a party defendant by service of process on the District Attorney. You will therefore resist the jurisdiction of the Court so far as the United States is concerned.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Notwithstanding the delay in replying to your letter, I have been unable to ascertain definitely what course the Comptroller of Currency proposes touching the fund which it is claimed belonged to the First National Bank of Selma. The attention of the Comptroller has been called to this matter, and I suppose that he will give the Receiver instructions as to the course to be pursued by him.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">&amp; Acting Attorney General.</span>
