            <span class="tei_ab">To the President.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Senator Stewart has filed in this office additional papers upon the subject of the Judges in Utah. I send you herewith a digest of them, supposing that you would not care to peruse the voluminous originals.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I do not think that these papers substantially vary the case from what it was at the time of your action upon it several weeks ago.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Since that action, papers have been filed remonstrating against the removal of the Judges. Among them was one from Senator Wright, of Iowa, &amp; one from Mr. Poland, of the House of Representatives.</span>

            precedent to remove Judges, (except in a clear case of official demerit,) at the instance of litigants, or their attorneys.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman, Attorney General.</span>
