      <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 24, 1871.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Hon. Richard H. Whitely,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">House of Representatives,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Washington, D.C.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date, enclosing one to
        you from Mr. Samuel Lindsay, of Georgia, defendant 
         in a suit brought by the
        United States in the Southern District of Georgia, on a post office bond, as surety for one
        Heald.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">He requests that directions shall be given to the District Attorney to stop the suit.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Last April when I was acting as District Attorney for Georgia I found this case upon the
        docket. It was continued, according to my recollection, at the special instance of
        defendant's counsel. Though I should be glad to accommodate Mr. Lindsay, I would not be
        justified in forbearing to press a claim on the part of the Government, which appears to be
        a lawful one.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Should a judgment be entered against him, the relief which he desires to obtain from
        Congress can be as effectually granted then as now.</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
      <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
