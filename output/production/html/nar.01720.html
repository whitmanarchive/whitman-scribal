            <span class="tei_ab">Feb. 11, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. John L. Murphy,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Asso. Justice of the Sup. Ct. of Montana Terr.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Knoxville, Tenn.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your letter of the 9th instant has been received.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I think it very desirable that the courts should be regularly held in the Territories—and though I have no doubt that your reasons are good for delaying your departure until the first of March, yet I shall be very much gratified if you can arrive in the Territory in season to hold Court at the appointed time. I am unable to say with certainty when the Courts will be held—but have communicated to day to Mr. Maynard for your behalf all the information on that subject of which I am in possession.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
