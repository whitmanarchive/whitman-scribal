            <span class="tei_ab">George A. Hitchcock, Esq.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">San Diego, Cal.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received yours of the 8th instant, enclosing an original petition, and a copy from certain settlers in Jamuel Valley.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">My understanding of the matter is, that the case is now before the Supreme Court, on appeal from California. To repeated applications made on the one part for the dismissal of the appeal, and to remonstrances against such dismissal, on the other part, I have made the uniform reply that I shall not dismiss, unless on investigation preparatory to argument it shall appear that there is no case for the United States.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I will thank you, or any other gentleman interested for the settlers, for a brief of points and authorities.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
