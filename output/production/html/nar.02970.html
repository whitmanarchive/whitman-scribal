            <span class="tei_ab">March 18, 1871.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Hon. C. Delano.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Secretary of the Interior.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Sir:</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">I have received your letter of the 16th instant, recommend the reäppointment of Charles P. Webster, and the appointment of Thomas D. Bond, as Justices of the Peace, in the District of Columbia.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">The 24th Section of the Act of February 21, 1871, to provide a government for the District of Columbia, gives the appointment of the Justices of the Peace to the Legislative Assembly of the District, with a proviso that all Justices of the Peace, and notaries public now in commission shall continue in office until their present commissions expire, unless sooner removed, according to existing laws.</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">It seems to me that this prohibits any new appointments after the passage of that Act, except such as shall be made under the provisions which shall be enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the District; and it is for this reason—and not from any disposition to disregard your recommendation—that I decline to recommend to the President any appointments to such offices.</span>            
            <span class="tei_ab">Very respectfully,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Your obedient serv't,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">A. T. Akerman,</span>
            <span class="tei_ab">Attorney General.</span>
