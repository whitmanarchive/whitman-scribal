           <ab>July 8, 1869.</ab>
            <ab>Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</ab>
            <ab>Secretary of the Treasury.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>I have considered the Internal Revenue case of Wagner &amp; Munch, to which your letter of the 7th inst. relates. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has decided to accept in discharge of their liability in a suit pending in court, with your approval, and my recommendation, their offer to pay the sum of $500 as specific penalty, and all costs amounting to $350. I recommend the acceptance of their offer, with the single exception that the costs are to be taxed in some legal manner, and this amount is to be paid, whether it is greater or less
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="nar.01968.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            than $350. I have respectfully to suggest that in all cases where costs are paid, the items of costs should be made known to the office of the Commissioner, either before or after they are paid, that a public record may be kept of the amount received in this manner by any officer of the United States.</ab>
            <ab>I have the honor to be, &amp;c, &amp;c,</ab>
            <ab>E. R. Hoar,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
