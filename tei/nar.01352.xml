            <ab>Wm. Alexander, Esq.</ab>
            <ab>Austin, Texas</ab>
            <ab>Dear Sir:</ab>
            <ab>It is very difficult to obtain trustworthy information from Texas in regard to officers or candidates for office and believing that any information received from you will be entirely honest and trustworthy, I am induced to apply to you confidentially in regard to a matter which has arisen in your neighborhood. Complaints have been addressed to this office in regard to the official conduct of Thomas F. Purnell, the Marshal of Western Texas, by officers connected with the Internal Revenue Department, especially in regard to his intimacy with Horace Boughton, who is charged with defrauding the Government. Will you be so kind as to inform me whether, in your opinion, and that of the respectable part of the community, Mr. Purnell is a capable, efficient and honest officer, or otherwise? I wish to know whether he is such a man as it is proper for us to retain in office, with the expectation that he will not only be honest himself, but will discharge his duties in such a way as to insure the enforcement of the laws, the suppression of frauds, and the bringing of offenders to justice. Any information which you may give me will be regarded as wholly confidential, if you desire it.</ab>
            <ab>Very respectfully,</ab>
            <ab>E. R. Hoar, Attorney General.</ab>
