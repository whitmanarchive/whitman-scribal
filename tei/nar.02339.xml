            <ab>Little Rock, Ark.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>It appears from copies of the libel, decree of condemnation, and petition of the
                party to the President&#8212;to which is appended a recommendation of the Judge,
                and another of O. Jennings, Esq. late United States Attorney&#8212;that the law
                library of George A. Gallagher, Esq. was libelled and duly condemned in the United
                States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, under the confiscation<note type="editorial" resp="wwa">In the body of this letter, someone other than Whitman has replaced the word "execution" with "confiscation."</note> laws; but that no order of sale has ever passed the Court,&#8212;and the books are in the

                custody of
                the Marshal. The Honorable Henry C. Caldwell, District Judge of the United States
                for the District of Arkansas, states, in writing, that the sale of Mr. Gallagher's
                library would result in scattering it, to the great prejudice of the Courts and bar
                of Little Rock,&#8212;and that the conduct of Mr. Gallagher has been
                unexceptionable. He earnestly recommends the President to grant "a <unclear
                    reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#crl">remittance</unclear> of the
                forfeiture." To Judge Caldwell's recommendation the late District Attny subjoins his own.</ab>
            <ab>It also appears that an indictment for treason was found against Mr. Gallagher, from
                which he has been judicially relieved upon a regular plea of pardon&#8212;the
                discharge being shown by a certified copy before me, of the order of the Court in
                the premises.</ab>
