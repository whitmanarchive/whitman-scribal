            <ab>November 4, 1867.</ab>
            <ab>L. H. Chandler, Esq.</ab>
            <ab>United States District Attorney,</ab>
            <ab>Richmond, Va.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>I wrote you on the 25th ultimo, in relation to the trial of Mr. Davis, and have since had no communication from you. I now enclose copy of a letter just received from Mr. Evarts and Mr. Dana, associated with you in the prosecution of the case. I beg to call your special attention to the first point referred to in their letter, viz., the preparation of the indictment, and I would suggest that, without delay, you frame such an indictment as you think necessary, and submit it to your Associate Counsel for revision, and, if deemed necessary by you or them, to arrange for a consultation here, either as to the indictment, or any other matter which you deem necessary.</ab>
            <ab>It would be well, besides preparing the indictment, to prepare carefully an abstract of the proofs necessary to be made out, and of the evidence, oral and written, which you expect to adduce, and to furnish your associates with such an abstract also for their consideration.</ab>
            <ab>The time fixed for the trial being so near at hand, I deem it proper again to call your early attention to this important subject, and to ask you to acknowledge promptly the receipt of this communication, and to advise me what steps you have taken towards the preparation of the case.</ab>
            <ab>Yours very respectfully,</ab>
            <ab>Henry Stanbery,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
            
        </body>
    </text>
