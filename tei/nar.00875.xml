            <ab>April 20, 1869.</ab>
            <ab>Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,</ab>
            <ab>Secretary of the Treasury.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a communication received at this office from the U. S. Attorney from the Dist. of Columbia dated the 7th inst. respecting the case of E. B. Olmstead, formerly disbursing clerk and Superintendent of the Post Office Department&#8212;together with the papers to which reference is therein made.</ab>
            <ab>It appears from a letter of my predecessor to the Dist. Attorney, of the 3d of March last, a copy whereof is among the papers mentioned, that a proposition for a settlement of the claim of the United States against Olmstead, growing out of his defalcation as disbursing clerk, having been approved by the late Postmaster General, was communicated to the then Secretary of the Treasury, who likewise favored a settlement according to the terms offered;&#8212;in view of which, in connection with other circumstances alluded to by the late Attorney General, he expressed himself as disposed to sanction a discontinuance of further proceedings against Olmstead, upon the completion of the settlement proposed on his behalf. I am not advised that any farther steps have been taken in the direction of a settlement since the date of that letter.</ab>
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="nar.00875.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            <ab>As the subject of compromising the claim seems to fall within the cognizance of your Department, (see Sec. 10, Act of March 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 740,) and these papers appearing to relate to that subject they are accordingly referred to you for such disposition as you may deem proper to be made of them. The Dist. Attorney will be informed of this reference, and instructed to be guided by your action in the premises.</ab>
            <ab>I am Sir, with great respect, &amp;c.</ab>
            <ab>E. R. Hoar,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
