            <ab>Hon. J. F. Chaves,</ab>
            <ab>Delegate from New Mexico.</ab>
            <ab>Dear Sir:</ab>
            <ab>I have received your note of the 24th instant, and in reply would say that it seems to me necessary and proper that there should be on file in this office an application from the Judge himself requesting his leave of absence, and stating the facts and circumstances which lead him to desire it. If such a letter is received from Judge Palen, undoubtedly the request would be granted. If you choose to notify him that it will be, if there is not time for him to send on and obtain permission before the time when he proposed to leave, you can do so, and he can send his formal application afterward. It is from no disinclination to oblige him, nor from any discourtesy to you that I have made the suggestions which I have&#8212;but because I think it both proper and important that the communication of the Judge should be made directly with this office.</ab>
       <ab>Very respectfully,</ab>
<ab>E. R. Hoar,</ab>
<ab>Attorney General.</ab>
