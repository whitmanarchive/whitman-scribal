            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>Your letter of the 17th inst. was received. I learn that the "Anna," after an examination, has been released. By a communication from the District Attorney, it appears that the libel was filed upon an affidavit of the Spanish Consul at Charleston, before any directions were received from this office, and that the reason the Marshal was obliged to put the crew and passengers on shore, was because they were so insolent, violent and abusive, that he found himself unable to serve his process without so doing. He informs me also that steam was got up after the Marshal had taken possession of the vessel, and that the passengers or crew, whose conduct seemed to meet the approbation of the officers, discharged the contents of the boiler into the hold, deranged the pumps, and obviously attempted either to blow up or sink the vessel, which they nearly succeeded in doing.</ab>
            <ab>It has been my intention, as you are aware, that no inconvenience or expense should be imposed upon you that was not necessary to a proper care for the observance of the laws of the land&#8212;and I fear that most of the trouble that has occurred, is to be attributed to the misconduct of

            <ab>Very respectfully,</ab>

            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
