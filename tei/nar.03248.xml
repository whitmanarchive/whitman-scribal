            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>Senator Stewart has filed in this office additional papers upon the subject of the Judges in Utah. I send you herewith a digest of them, supposing that you would not care to peruse the voluminous originals.</ab>
            <ab>I do not think that these papers substantially vary the case from what it was at the time of your action upon it several weeks ago.</ab>
            <ab>Since that action, papers have been filed remonstrating against the removal of the Judges. Among them was one from Senator Wright, of Iowa, &amp; one from Mr. Poland, of the House of Representatives.</ab>
            <ab>Mr. Stewart says that the parties in the litigation in which he is interested have agreed to submit it to the arbitration, and therefore he withdraws it from the courts; but that he is still desirous, upon public grounds, that the Judges should be removed.</ab>
            <ab>The best judgment which I can form upon the matter is this: that while it is possible that the Judges have become involved in mining interests to a greater extent than was wise, in view of the amount of litigation affecting such interests, yet there is no evidence of official corruption or partiality&#8212;and I think that it would not be a wholesome

            precedent to remove Judges, (except in a clear case of official demerit,) at the instance of litigants, or their attorneys.</ab>
            <ab>Very respectfully</ab>
