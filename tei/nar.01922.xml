            <ab>June 21, 1869.</ab>
            <ab>Messrs. M. C. Huntoon, W. A. Brown, and others,</ab>
            <ab>Lowell, Mass.</ab>
            <ab>Gentlemen:</ab>
            <ab>Your letter of May 21, 1869, addressed to me, relating to the sentence of Patrick P. Haggerty, was received by due course of mail, and was forwarded to the U. S. District Attorney at Boston, calling his attention particularly to the statements which it contained. A report from his office has been received this morning, by which it appears that you were to some extent misinformed as to some of the facts in the case. Your letter was shown to the Judges in the Circuit Court. As you are undoubtedly aware, nothing can be done in this case except to call the attention of the prosecuting officers to your complaint&#8212;and while I have no reason to doubt their fidelity or careful attention to their duty, or that the Court exercised its best judgement upon the case presented by the record, the knowledge that such a complaint is made will undoubtedly produce all the effect which is due to it, in consideration of the respectable source from which it emanates.</ab>
            <ab>Very Respectfully,</ab>
            <ab>E. R. Hoar,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
            
        </body>
