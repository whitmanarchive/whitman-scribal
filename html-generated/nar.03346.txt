            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst. transmitting the copy of one from Hon. J. Hubley Ashton, and the account therein referred to of James P. Newcomb, amounting to $101, for expenses incurred in securing the deposition of Captain James Speed, in the case of the claim of Leon Aragon before the Mexican Claims Commission.
            In reply I have to inform you that the account is a proper charge on the appropriation under the control of this Department "for defending claims under the convention with Mexico,"—but owing to the failure of Mr. Newcomb to receipt the account, it cannot now be paid. It is therefore respectfully returned in order that it may be transmitted to Mr. Newcomb for his receipt. When it is received at this Department properly receipted, it will be paid
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't servant,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            and Acting Attorney General.
            acc't of Mr. Newcomb.
