            Nov. 13, 1871.
            Mr. D. L. Eaton, Actuary of the Freedmen's Saving's &amp; Trust Company,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the 8th inst. You misunderstand my position. I do not hold that by failing to use the building after it was in readiness for use, and the term of contract had begun, that we could be excused from rent. I only hold that, as it was part of the contract that you should have the rooms in readiness, and they should be heated, (which of course means in readiness for our general official uses, and adequate heating for such uses,) we were not bound to pay until you had it in such readiness, heating included.
            According to my information, this was not the case until the 25th of October. But, as a compromise, not unreasonable in view of the circumstance that we began to move our books and furniture here some two weeks before, I feel at liberty to pay from the time indicated in my former letter.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
