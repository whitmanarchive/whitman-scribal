            Rufus Waterman, Esq.
            Pres't. of the Nat'l. Exchange Bank,
            Providence, R. I.
            Sir:
            Yours of the 8th inst. is received. The request which you make for the postponement of the case against Wm. H. Corey, has been the subject of a correspondence between the Solicitor of the Treasury and the U. S. Attorney for Rhode Island,—and in a letter from the
            declining to postpone case ag't W. H. Corey
            
            
            
            Solicitor to the District Attorney, under date of October 13, 1870, the latter was advised that no good reason appeared for any further delay in the prosecution.
            No different direction will be given by this Department, unless the explanations which shall be made by Mr. Jenckes upon his proposed visit to Washington—or some other information, not now possessed by me—shall show that the public interests will admit of the desired postponement.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
