            Hon Wm. H. Seward,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to request, for the use of this office in a case before the Supreme Court, a copy of the correspondence between your Department, &amp; Hon. Charles Francis Adams, relative to the decision of the British Chancery Court assuming the United States to be the successors of the Confederate States in respect to property of the latter—&amp; particularly a copy of your letter repudiating that doctrine.
            Copies in print in any form will answer. Please send as soon as convenient.
            With great respect
            I remain
            29

            Sec. of State
            Leut.
            Rec.
