            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 20th inst. relative to alleged illegal expeditions now in progress at various Southern ports for the purpose of aiding the insurgents in the Island of Cuba, and to the case of a steamer being fitted out at Jacksonville or Fernandina for the purpose of committing depredations on Spanish commerce as a privateer under the flag of the insurgents referred to.
            As suggested, such instructions have been issued to the officers of the Government subject to the orders of this Department, as, it is hoped, many lead to the prevention or punishment of any such violations of the laws of the United States.
            Very resp., &amp;c. &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Att'y Gen
