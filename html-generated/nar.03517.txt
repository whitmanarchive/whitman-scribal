            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 7th instant, with the enclosed copy of a note of the 1st inst. from the Spanish Minister, and its accompaniments, relative to the prosecutions of Jordan and Ryan in the Southern District of New York.
            I yesterday had a personal conference with the District Attorney in New York on the subject of these prosecutions, and am satisfied that he is using all the means in his power to obtain testimony, and to make good the accusations against the defendants.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            Jordan and Ryan's cases, N. Y.
