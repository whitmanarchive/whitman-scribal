            Hon. J. J. Martin,
            Auditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Department.
            Sir:
            You will perceive, upon an examination of the enclosed letter of Mr. Epes, which you referred to this office, that he requests information which can only be furnished by the Post Office Department—and therefore I return the papers to you.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            (enc)
            papers returned.
