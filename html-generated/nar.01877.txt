           John W. Noble, Esq.
           St. Louis, Mo.
           Sir:
           You are hereby retained as special assistant to the U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, for the defence of the suit instituted by A. J. Fox against Capt. William Myers, A.D.M., U. S. Army, which has lately been brought in a State Court in Missouri—the same being a renewal of the suit previously instituted by said Fox, and transferred to the Circuit Court of the United States for said District, and there terminated by a voluntary non-suit at April term, 1871.
           You will take, and forward to this office the oath
               retained as special counsel.                Mo. 
               
               
           required to be taken by District Attorneys.
           Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
