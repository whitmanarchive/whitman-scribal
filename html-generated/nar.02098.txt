            Mr. Drury Thompson,
            Mobile, Ala.
            Sir:
            The President has referred to me your letter to him of the 15th instant requesting a removal of your disabilities.
            The power to remove disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution is in Congress, and not in the President. I therefore suggest that you send your application to some member of Congress.

            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            removing disabilities
            695
