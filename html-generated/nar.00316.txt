            W. Dorscheimer, Esq.
            United States Attorney.
            Buffalo, New York.
            Sir:
            An order has been issued by the War Department to the Commandant of the Watervliet Arsenal, to surrender the arms claimed as Fenian arms, transferred from Rouse's Point on the order of the Attorney General, through you as District Attorney.
            I hereby authorize you to take the same proceedings as to these arms, (if shown to be Fenian arms,) which were had in respect to the other Fenian arms, both as to taking bounds, and to their delivery to such person or persons as prove themselves entitled to the same.
            Respectfully, &amp;c. yours,
            Henry Stanbery
            Attorney General.
