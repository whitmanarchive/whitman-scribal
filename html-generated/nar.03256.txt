            Hon. Columbus Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I send you the copy of a letter lately received from C. K. Davis, Esq., U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, on the subject of Mr. Harriman's relation to the suits in Minnesota, for timber cut by trespassers on Government lands in Wisconsin.
            I shall be happy to give to the District Attorney any directions in the matter which the Department of the Interior desires.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
