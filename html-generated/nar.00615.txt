            To the Ass't Treasurer,
            at New York.
            Dear Sir:
            Will you be kind enough to inform me whether there are on deposit in your hands any proceeds of the prize steamer "Wren," libelled in the Dist. Court of the U. S. for the southern Dist. of Florida. It is important that the Government should know immediately whether the claimants have received payment of these proceeds.
            Yours very respectfully,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Assistant Attorney General
