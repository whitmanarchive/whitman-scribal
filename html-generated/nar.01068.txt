            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3d inst. with a letter from Lieut. Richard L. Hoxie, of the corps of Engineers, enclosed, all relating to land claimed by the United States at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri.
            The Report of Lieut. Hoxie is not definite enough to enable me to give any opinion upon the validity of the claims of the persons named in his report; and I have respectfully to suggest that the United States Attorney for the Western District of Missouri be instructed to investigate these claims, and report in detail to me, to be transmitted to your Department—and, meanwhile, to appear in and defend the suit referred to in Lieut. Hoxie's report, if it shall appear that the decisions in that suit will affect the interests of the United States in respect to any part of this land. If this course meets your approval, you will please inform me
            land at Jefferson Barracks, Mo.
            
            in order that I may give the necessary instructions.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient serv't,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
