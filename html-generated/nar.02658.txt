            Dec. 8, 1871.
            Hon. Z. Wheat,
            Shelbyville, Ky.
            Dear Sir:
            Your letter of the 21st ultimo
            96
            
            
            
            
            addressed to the President, and requesting him to issue a pardon to Simeon Cook, charged with making an assault on Gibson, the U.S. Mail Agent, has been referred to this Department.
            It is not the practice of the Department to respond to letters of this character otherwise than by advising the President upon the question presented. But in view of your known high character, and the earnestness with which you make the request, I deem it proper to say that I could not under any circumstances advise the President to extend Executive clemency to a party who had not submitted to a process of arrest. I am not aware of any case in which the Government has granted pardon to a party who was evading process of arrest; and I think upon reflection your own good sense will suggest the propriety of such a course.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            
                        question of Simeon Cook's pardon
            Ky.
