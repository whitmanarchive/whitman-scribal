            John J. McGilord, Esq.
            Seattle, Washington Ty.
            Sir: I have received your letter of the 21st ultimo. The brief in the Smith case has not yet been prepared. As soon as it is prepared, if at all, I will send you a copy. I should inform you, however, that it is not the custom of the Court to hear a writ of error in favor of a party who has absconded—which I understand is the case with Smith.
              Case of Smith
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
