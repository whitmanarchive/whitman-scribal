            Hon. Jos. H.S. Wilson,
            Commissioner General Land Office
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult. with the accompanying papers, all relating to a private land claim in California, known as "Suerte en Dolores" in which you refer to a letter to you from this office of the date of June 29, 1868.
            Since that letter, as far as I am able to ascertain, no directions
                land claim "Suerte en Dolores" Cal.
            
            
            have been given by the Attorney General looking to the institution of judicial proceedings for the vacation of the confirmatory decree, and no papers have been filed in this office, asking any such directions.
            I have no present intention of instructing the United States Attorney at San Francisco to attempt to obtain a reversal of the judgment in this case.
            The papers transmitted with your letter are returned herewith.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
