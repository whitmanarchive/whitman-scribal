            D. H. Starbuck, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Salem, N. C.
            Sir:
            This will be delivered to you by Mr. R. M. Sherman, of this Department, who will confer with you in relation to the prosecution of parties
                
            Sherman's investigation
                
            
            
            supposed to be guilty of attempting, with more or less success, in your District, frauds upon the Government in the matter of claims presented to the Second Auditor. He will make you acquainted with the views of the Department in the matter, and will put you in possession of material facts.
            I desire that after conference with him you will take such steps as are likely to bring the offenders to justice.—You are also requested to render him all aid which he may need in his investigations.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
