            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ult. enclosing a bill of the District Attorney for the District of Columbia, for services in connection with the title of a piece of land recently acquired by the United States for Washington AcqueductAqueduct purposes.
            Referring to the opinion of Assistant Attorney General Hill, approved by Mr. Bristow, Acting Attorney General, and transmitted to you on the 19th of June last, you will see that this Department has expressed the opinion that such charges are legally payable by the War Department out of the appropriation for the land. And therefore I return the account.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain land title expenses
            D. C.
