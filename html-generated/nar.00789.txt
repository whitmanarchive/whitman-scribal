            Hon. Jno. S. Watts,
            Ch. Just. Sup. Court, New Mex.
            Sir:
            The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of the joint letter of yourself and Judge Houghton, relative to a supposed effort for the removal of Dist. Att'y Elkins, dated the 2d inst.; and to say in reply that he knows of no such application - but from all he can learn he is pleased to be able to concur in your opinion of his value as a public officer, and the importance of retaining him.
            Very respectfully yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clerk.
