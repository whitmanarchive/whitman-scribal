            Wm. G. Whiteley, Esq.
            Wilmington, Del.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 3d instant.
            It occurs to me that the question which your letter presents is more proper for the decision of the Judiciary than for the decision of this office. I presume that the practice in your District admits of a motion to the Court to correct an erroneous taxation of costs by the officer; and under such a motion the court can determine the law of the case.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain question of law.
