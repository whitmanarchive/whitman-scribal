            E. B. Turner, Esq.
            United States District Attorney,
            Austin, Texas.
            Sir:
            Application has been made at this Office, on behalf of E. B. Nichols and others, defendants in one case, and John C. Robertson, and others, defendants in another case, for the dismissal of suits brought against them respectively by the United States as plaintiffs in the Circuit Court for the Western District of Texas,—the cases being numbered 938 and 939. Certified copies of the petitions filed by you in each of these cases, have been furnished to me, and also copies of the summons in each case.
            I have to request that you make, at your earliest convenience, a report of the facts upon which these proceedings are instituted, and of the grounds upon which you rely for a recovery, and to stay proceedings in both the cases until you are further advised from this office.
            Very respectfully yours,
            Henry Stanbery,
            Attorney General.
