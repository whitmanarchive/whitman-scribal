            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the papers referred to me under cover of your letter of the 18th inst., touching the proposed compromise of a suit brought by the United States ag't the Minnesota Railway Company, to recover penalties claimed, under the 122d Sec. of the Internal Revenue Law, of June 30, 1864, which is pending in the District Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota. The circumstances of the case, as there disclosed, appear to entitle it to favorable consideration—and I doubt not that substantial justice will be fully attained by compromising it upon the terms suggested by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and approved by you. I accordingly recommend that a compromise of the suit
                
                Compromise of suit—U. S. ag't. Minnesota RR. Co.
            
            
            be made on those terms.
            I am Sir, with great respect, &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
