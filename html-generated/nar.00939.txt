            E. W. Andrews, Esq.
            Harper's Ferry, West Va.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 1st ult., informing us that circumstances beyond your control will prevent you being present at the trial of the action of ejectment, Jacob B. Brown, vs. Daniel J. Young, was duly received.
            After correspondence with Mr. Smith and the District Attorney, the Attorney General has concluded to employ Mr. H. H. Blackburn, of Martinsburg, to assist the former in the case and you are accordingly requested to turn over to him all the papers relating to it which are now in your hands.
            Very resp. yours,
            W. A. Field,
            Ass't. Attorney General.
