            Hon. J. D. Cox,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 15th inst. relative to the payment of the acct's of R. R. Heath and seventeen others, as assistants to Dist. Attorneys and to state that if you will transmit them to the accounting officers of the Treasury, with directions to pay so much of them as accrued prior to March 3d, 1869, I will inform the Assistant Dist. Attorneys to that effect.
            I see no reason, at present, for questioning your decision in the premises.
            I am Sir, with great Respect,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
