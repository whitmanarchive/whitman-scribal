           Sir:
           I have received your letter of the 21st instant, asking for information in regard to an opinion of the Attorney General in reference to the bounty payable to soldiers who were discharged either by the expiration of their terms of service, or by the close of the war. In reply I send you a printed copy of the opinion.
           Very respectfully,
           E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General
            (enc.)
            Bounty question
