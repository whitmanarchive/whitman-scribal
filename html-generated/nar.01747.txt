            Mr.  James McAndrew,
            Augusta, Geo.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 10th instant.
            I know of no appropriation out of which such claims as your can be paid. Certainly there is none under the control of the Attorney General. The question has often been discussed in Congress whether the Government
            no fund to pay, &amp;c.
            
            
            
            should pay such claims—and until Congress shall authorize the payment of them they must remain unpaid.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
