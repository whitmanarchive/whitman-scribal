            Hon. David Noggle, Chief Justice Supreme Court, Idaho Territory.
            Sir:
            Absence and sickness have prevented an earlier response to your letter of September 3d.
            It has not been customary for Attorneys General to give opinions on legal questions, except upon the call of the President, or of the Head of some other Department; and therefore I do not feel at liberty to give the opinion which you desire.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            declining opinion
