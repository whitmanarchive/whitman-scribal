         Hon. Geo. P. Fisher, U.S. Attorney,
         Washington, D. C.
         Sir:
         I enclose certain papers sent to this Department by Mr. J. H. H. Woodward, of Louisville, Ky.; and also the copy of a letter from him charging that certain crimes against the United States have been committed by Samuel McKee, formerly a Member of Congress from Kentucky. The charge seems to be that the crimes in question were perpetrated in Washington.
         I therefore desire that you will look into the case, and if it appears that the allegations against McKee are well founded, that you will institute a prosecution.
         Very respectfully,
         A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Charges ag't. Sam'l McKee
            Ky.
