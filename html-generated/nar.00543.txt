            Hugo Von Block,
            129 Atlantic street,
            Brooklyn, N. Y.
            Sir:
            The Attorney General ad interim has received your letter of the 12th instant, in which you enclose certificate of your discharge from the United States military service—which I herewith return to you.
            Your object is to collect bounty money, which you claim to be due from the government,—and as the Judge Advocate General informed you that the decision against you was in conformity to the opinion of the Attorney General, you have submitted your case to this office. But we have nothing whatever to do with the settlement of claims, and the advice which has been given by the Attorney General, which is referred to by General Holt, was the opinion of the former as to the meaning of the law, which, having given, this office has done with the matter.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
