           May 13, 1869.
            B. H. Smith, Esq.
            Charlestown
            Kanawha Co. West Va.
            Sir:
            I transmit herewith a copy of a letter from E. W. Andrews, Esq. dated April 1st, 1869, in relation to the ejectment suit of Jacob B. Brown, vs. Dan'l J. Young.
            It appears that Mr. Andrews, who was engaged by you, with the sanction of the Attorney Gen'l. Mr. Stanbery, to appear for the def't. will not be able to be present at the trial of the case, and recommends the employment of John W. Kennedy, Esq. of Charlestown in his place. It is desirable to know whether in your opinion, other counsel are needed, than yourself and the U. S. Dist. Att'y.—and if any be needed, who would be a proper person to select.
            It may be well to say that Mr. Goff having been written to on the subject, declines to recommend the employment of Mr. Kennedy, but suggests the name of H. H. Blackburn, Esq. of Martinsburg.
            Very Resp. yours,
            W. A. Field,
            Ass't Attorney Gen'l.
