            New York City.
            Sir:
            In reply to your letter of the 8th ultimo, asking that the case of the Schooner "Isabel" may be docketed and dismissed, in accordance with Rule 9 of the Supreme Court, I have to say that a full certificate under the seal of the Court, as to the fact of the appeal having been taken, the time when, and the parties by whom, must be furnished, before that motion can be made.
            Very respectfully, yours
            Henry Stanbery
