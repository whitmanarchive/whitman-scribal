      C. W. Wessen, Esq.
      Florence, Ala.
      Sir:
      Your letter of the 20th ult. to the Secretary of State has been referred by him to this
        Department.
      I cannot act in the matter unless I have official information that your son was in the
        line of military duty when he did the act for which he is prosecuted. And this information
        should come from the War Department. I suggest therefore that you obtain from your son's
        officers statements of the facts, and cause them to be forwarded to the War Department.
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
      certain case Ala.
