            Hon. Coles Bashford,
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            In your communication of the 17th, you state that no Attorney of the United States is on duty in the Territory of Arizona. Our records show that John A. Rush is the Attorney for that Territory. He has been called upon by letter of this date to report whether he is at his post and engaged in his official duties. No action can be had in this case of Neville until an Attorney of the United States shall have reported himself.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
