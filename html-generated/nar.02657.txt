            R. M. Sherman, Esq.
            Care of U.S. Attorney,
            Knoxville, Tenn.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith the certified statement of the military service of William D. Sparks, asked for in your last letter to the Attorney General.
            The certificates you sent for are not on the files of the 2d Auditor. He referred one to the 2d Comptroller, but upon application to that officer he informs me that they are not on his files. I cannot therefore furnish them. Perhaps they are among your papers.
            Please sign the receipts enclosed in the Attorney General's last letter, and send them to me at once.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
