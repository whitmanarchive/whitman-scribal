Hon. Zeph. Turner,
House of Delegates,
Richmond, Va.
Sir:
I am directed by the Attorney General, in consequence of the great pressure of public business, to say, that he regrets to be unable to give you an opinion upon the question presented in your letter of the 25th inst. Apart from the fact that it might commit him beforehand upon questions likely to arise in the regular course of administration, he is forbidden by law from giving opinions on points of law, unless propounded by the President, or the Head of an Executive Department. He hopes, therefore, that you will excuse him for not complying with your request.
Respectfully yours,
M. F. Pleasants,
Chief Clerk.
