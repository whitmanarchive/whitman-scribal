            Hon. Geo. M. Robeson,
            Secretary of the Navy.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of the late Secretary of the Navy, dated June 25th ult., transmitting certain papers relating to the claim of Paymaster Schenck, of the Navy, and requesting the opinion of the Attorney General upon the questions of law involved. The questions of law upon which my opinion is requested are not stated, and there is among the papers no statement of the facts on which the claim is based; and I am unable to make up such a statement from the papers transmitted. I, therefore, feel under the necessity of returning the papers to you, and of asking that, if my opinion is still desired upon any questions of law connected with the consideration of the claim, a statement of the facts of the case, and of the questions of law upon which you wish my opinion may be sent to me. That all the papers relating to this claim may be kept together, I send also certain papers transmitted to this office by the attorney of Paymaster Schenck.
            Very Respectfully yours,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
