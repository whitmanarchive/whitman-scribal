            Hon. H. H. Wells,
            Governor of Virginia,
            Richmond, Va.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 16th inst. enclosing one addressed to you by Gov. Letcher, came to my hands only this morning, in consequence of my absence from the city. In reply I need only say that it is not expected that the trial of Mr. Davis will be brought on until a day during the term hereafter to be assigned, and which will permit of due notice being given to the witnesses before their attendance will be required.
            I have the honor to be,
            Very respectfully,
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General
