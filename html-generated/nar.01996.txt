            Sir:
            The Attorney General has referred to me your letter of the 14th instant, asking for a copy of "a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in a case coming from Montana, which decides in a measure the character of the United States Courts in the Territories"; and requested me to answer the same.
            I do not know to what case you refer, unless it be the case of Dunphy vs. Kleinschmidt, et al, decided by the Supreme Court just
            
            
            
                sending certain Sup. Court decision
            
            
                
            before the recent adjournment—a copy of which Opinion is herewith sent you.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow,
            Solicitor General.
