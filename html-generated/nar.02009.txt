            A. Randall, Esq.
            Annapolis, Md.
            Sir:          
            I have received your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to certain old articles of furniture formerly used by late Attorney General Wirt in his office.
            
            Owing to the sickness of the gentleman in this office who has information in regard to the furniture in question, I have been unable to give your request attention. I hope in a few days to
            certain furniture
            
                
            ascertain what furniture there is in the office that can be spared, and will then advise you further.
          
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
