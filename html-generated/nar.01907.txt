            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst. relating to a suit in rem. arising under the Internal Revenue laws, against the contents of a tobacco factory, situated at Cross Roads, Bedford Co. Va., claimed by S. G. Stewart.
            Mr. Stewart proposes to compromise this suit by paying the sum of Fifteen hundred dollars, and that this compromise shall not affect the right of the U. S. to prosecute any indictments already presented, or hereafter to be presented, or any claim of the United States for taxes. I recommend that such a compromise be made.
            The papers enclosed with your letter are herewith returned.
            I have the honor to remain, &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
