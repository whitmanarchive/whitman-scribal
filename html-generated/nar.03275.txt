            Hon. C. Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            On the 11th instant, I received from you the copy of a letter to yourself from the Hon. Wm. Lawrence, asserting the claim of certain settlers upon the Osage ceded lands in Kansas against the supposed title of certain railroad companies.
            As you do not request an opinion upon any of the questions
                disputed land title in Kansas
                
                suggested by this communication, I merely acknowledge the receipt of it, not conceiving that any further action will be necessary, unless Mr. Lawrence shall succeed in convincing you and me of the incorrectness of our previous views upon the subject.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
