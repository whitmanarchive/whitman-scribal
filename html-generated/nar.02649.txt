            S. M. Saunders, Esq.
            Nos. 54 and 56 Broad street,
            New York City.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 4th instant, I have to say that on the 26th of October last, the memorial of Mrs. Fanny Oaksmith, in relation to the claim of her late husband against the Republic of Hayti, for a balance due on a contract with that Republic, for the sale of the iron-clad "Atlanta" was referred to the Department of State, to which claims on foreign governments more properly pertain than to this Department.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain claim.
