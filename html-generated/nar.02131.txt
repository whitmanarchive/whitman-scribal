            Thos. F. Purnell, Esq. U. S. Marshal,
            Austin, Texas.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter
            of the 28th ultimo, relative to certain
           
            
            monies recieved by you for the
            sale of certain horses and mules
            sold under an interlocutory decree
            of the District Court of the United States
            for your District, and asking what
            disposition shall be made thereof,
            and how the necessary expenses of 
            keeping the animals and of the
            sale of the same shall be paid.
            In reply, I have to inform
            you that the money should remain
            where you have placed it—with the
            U. S. Depositary, to the credit of
            the Court, to abide the final result
            of the suit.  When the judgment is
            rendered, if it be in favor of the
            United States, the Court will then
            allow your costs and expenses
            out of the proceeds realized; but
            if, on the contrary, the suit should
            be determined in favor of the claimants,
            then the amount will, under
            the order of the Court, be returned 
            to them.  And you should render
            a special account for such costs
            and expenses as may have been incurred,
            to the First Auditor of the
            Treasury, by which officer it will
            be adjusted.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain moneys involved in pending suit.
            Texas.
