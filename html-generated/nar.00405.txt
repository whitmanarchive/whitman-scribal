            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith a communication from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and also a letter from Collector A. R. Root, touching an alleged exaction of illegal fees by Deputy Marshal Williams, of the Northern District of New York, from the owners of certain high wines—which were transmitted to the Attorney General, by your direction, on the 3d instant, with a request that steps might be taken to cause the amount of those fees to be refunded.
            
            see Ins. Book p 4 
            
            
             
            A Report respecting this matter has since been called for, and received, from the Marshal of that District, which shows that the fees collected by Deputy Williams in the case referred to have been regularly taxed and allowed by the District Judge for that District. A copy of this Report, with the fee-bill thus taxed, I herewith enclose for your information. Under the circumstances thus brought to view, it is respectfully submitted that if the parties concerned believe these fees to have been improperly taxed, their appropriate remedy is by application to the court to have them retaxed.
            I am, sir,
            Very Respectfully, your ob't serv't,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
