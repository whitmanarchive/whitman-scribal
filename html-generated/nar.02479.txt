            Hon. W. W. Brookings, Associate Justice.
            Yankton, Dakota.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 14th instant asking for a leave of absence from
                the Territory for five days—and in reply inform you that such leave is
                granted.
            I think that in all cases where absence is needed by Judges of the Territories, no
                matter for what length of time, application therefor should be made to this
                Department.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            leave of absence
