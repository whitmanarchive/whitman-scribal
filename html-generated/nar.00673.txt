            Sir:
            In reply to your request for leave of absence under date of October  last, the Attorney General directs me to say that, inasmuch as a similar request for ninety days from July 1, 1868, has been granted you, he does not consider it consistent with your official obligations to accord it.
            Very respectfully yours,
            W. F. Peddrick,
            Acting Chief Clerk.
