            Feb. 11, 1871.
            Hon. Columbus Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            The Hon. J. F. Asper, M. C. has referred to me a communication to him from the Hon. E. S. Parker, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, dated Feb. 8, 1871, in relation to the account of H. B. Branch, late Superintendent of Indians for the Central Superintendency.
            acc't, of H. B. Branch, (Indian office)
            
            
            Mr. Asper requests me to direct a continuance from the March term until the next succeeding term of the Court in Missouri, of the suit now pending in behalf of the United States, vs. said Branch and others.
            I do not feel at liberty to direct any delay in these proceedings without information from your Department that a good reason exists for such delay. Will you be good enough to inform me whether, in your judgment, any such reason exists.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
