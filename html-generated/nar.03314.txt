            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 30th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a letter to you from Gen. Howard, of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, reporting the discontinuance of a prosecution against one Willis et al. in Louisiana, for falsely personating one Brown, a soldier to whom bounty money was due—and requesting my views as to the legality and soundness of the action taken by the District Attorney.
            According to the Report of the case it seems to me that the offence of Willis et al was criminal under Section 18 of the crimes Act, of March 5, 1825, (8 U.S. Stat. 120,) and I have so informed the District Attorney. But as the Report is not very full, I have addressed that officer calling for a full report of the case, and of the grounds upon which he discontinued the prosecution. When his answer shall have been received I will give you a more deliberate opinion of the matter than at present I am able to form.
            Very respectfully &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
