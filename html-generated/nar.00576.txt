            Logan E. Bleckley, Esq.
            Counsellor at Law,
            Atlanta, Georgia
            Sir:
            A contract between you and Mr. Fitch, District Attorney for the District of Georgia, has been approved by the Attorney General adinterim, with this qualification, supposed to be unimportant to you, viz.: It is observed that you engaged to act as Assistant District Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. It is desirable that your field of duty should be coëxtensive with that of the United States Attorney, which, as you know, embraces the
            
            southern district also. A letter from you accepting this modification must precede the payment of any compensation in the premises.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
