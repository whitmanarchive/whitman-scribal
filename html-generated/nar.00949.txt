            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 8th inst. with the accompanying papers, all relating to the Internal Revenue case of William Owens. The terms of the proposed compromise are, that Owens pay, as tax, $1633 62/100, and as an assessed penalty $816 81/100, Total, $2450 43/100.
            
            Int. Rev. Case, William Owens.
            
            
            I leave entirely to the Department of the Treasury to determine whether any part of this sum shall be treated as a penalty, of which any person claiming to be an informer may be entitled to share.
            I recommend that the case be compromised by receiving the sum of money proposed.
            I am Sir, Very Respectfully, &amp;c
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
