            Hon. B. C. Cook, M. C.
            Chicago, Ill.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the 3d instant, in relation to the compensation
                
            
            
            to Mr. Glover, U.S. District Attorney, for the labor of replacing the records of the U.S. Courts destroyed by the late fire in Chicago.
            I have looked at the Act of March 3, 1871, to which you refer me, and see some difficulty in applying it to records of proceedings in which the U.S. was a party, though probably the Court would construe the Act to cover such cases. But I trust that the matter will be relieved of all difficulty by special legislation at the approaching session of Congress.
            I can now only say, generally, that if, under the law, it will be in my power to give adequate compensation to Mr. Glover, for the service required, I shall take great pleasure in doing so.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            restoring burnt Court records, Chicago Ill.
