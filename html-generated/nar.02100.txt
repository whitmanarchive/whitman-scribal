            Hon. Geo. P. Fisher,
            U. S. Attorney,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I have a communication from R. McPhail Smith, Esq. U. S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, requesting me to cause to be sent to him certain papers on file in the Second Auditor's office, relating to the payment of Capt. Beaty's company of Independent Scouts, to be used in evidence in prosecutions against Strohmier and Hatfield, at Nashville.
            In reply, I have advised him that the whole matter is in your hands for prosecution in this District, and consequently the papers will not be sent. I have also said to him that he will probably be called upon by you to assist in taking steps for the arrest and transportation of certain parties residing within his District—and requested him to render you any
            
            Stokes &amp; Powell fraud case
            
            
            assistance that may be desired.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
