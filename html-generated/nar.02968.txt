            Hon. R. C. McCormick,
            House of Representatives.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I have just received another report from the District Attorney of Arizona, to the effect that Mr. R. E. Phelps, the Marshal of that Territory, has been absent since the latter part of last December, and is now reported to be at the City of Mexico, and that money is due to jurors and witnesses who have been in attendance upon the Courts, Mr. Phelps not having furnished money to his Deputies for court expenses.
            As you have taken an interest in this matter I feel bound to inform you of this report, and to say to you that unless there is an immediate explanation, I will be obliged to recommend to the President an appointment of some other person in the place of Mr. Phelps.                   Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman, Attorney Gen'l.
            
            dereliction of U.S. Marshal Phelps, Arizona
