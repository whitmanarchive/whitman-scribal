            Albert H. Horton, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Atchison, Kansas.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 26th ult. in relation to the case of Charles H. Hayden has been received.
            Without determining whether you rightly construe the letters of the Postmaster General and of the Acting Attorney General, I now say that I fully agree with you that
                
                
            C. H. Hayden's case
            Kansas
                
            
            
            there should be a prompt and vigorous prosecution of this and of all other criminal cases, and that a trial should be obtained as soon as possible. If the court will allow the order of continuance to be set aside, and a trial to be had at this term, you will give that direction to the case provided the proof can be obtained now.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
