           December 6, 1869.
            Hon. James G. Blaine,
            Speaker of the House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            The second section of the "Act making appropriations for the Legislative, Executive and Judicial expenses of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1870," directs a Report to Congress by the heads of the several Executive Departments of "the number of desks in their several Departments, the number of clerks in their several Departments, the number employed therein during the preceding fiscal year, when employed, and when discharged, and the amount of compensation received by each, and what reduction, if any, can be made in the number of clerks of each grade."
            In compliance with this question I have the honor to Report that the number of clerks allowed to this Department by law is ten, classified as follows:
            
              
                One Law Clerk at an annual compensation of
                $2,500
              
            
            Report on Attorney Gen's Dept. 
            
            
              
                One chief clerk—annual compensation
                $2,200
              
              
              
                One clerk      "      "    
                2000
              
              
              
                Four clerks of class four
                1,800
              
              
              
                Two clerks of class three
                1,600
              
              
              
                One clerk of class one
                1,200
              
                 
            
              
            No vacancy occurred in these clerkships during the preceding fiscal year, and none has occurred during the present; and no changes have been made in these, except by resignation.
            In addition there was also employed during the last year, as there is at present, one clerk at annual compensation of $1600— paid from the appropriation for "legal assistance, and other necessary expenditures in the disposal of private land claims in California."
            While this force may be sufficient for the purely clerical needs of the office it is not, in my opinion, susceptible of reduction, consistently with the public interests.
            I have the honor to be,
            with great respect,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
