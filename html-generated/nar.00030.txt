            Attorney General's Office.
            August 14, 1865.
            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I beg to say, in returning the papers in the matter of the claim of Mansfield &amp; Co. of Memphis, Tenn. that I would much prefer that you would lay before me a statement of the facts on which the questions of law therein presented may be supposed to arise.
            I have looked sufficiently into the case to enable me to see that I ought not to give any opinion on it, until you advise me that I may assume that a certain state of facts is the one on which the questions you present arise.
            One question of fact I do not see at all alluded to in the papers, viz: whether the money claimed is or is not in the Treasury of the United States.
            I have the honor to be,
            Respectfully, &amp;c.
            James Speed
            Attorney General.
