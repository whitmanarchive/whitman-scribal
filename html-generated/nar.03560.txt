            The President.
            Sir:
            The case of John Pryor, to which your reference of Mr. Smith's letter to Gen. Blair relates, is not in this Department. We have this memorandum of it, that the offence is manslaughter, the sentence imprisonment for life by a court martial, and that the papers were referred to the Judge Advocate General, March 31, 1871.
            It is usual to refer to the Bureau of Military Justice all applications for pardon where the sentence was by a court martial. I have therefore referred the note
            
            case of John Pryor.
            
            
            
            to Gen. Blair to the Judge Advocate General, with the request that he will communicate with you upon the subject.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
