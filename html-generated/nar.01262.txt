            Geo. W. McGill, Esq.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of to-day in which you ask that the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives be furnished with the exact date of the employment of Hon. Jeremiah S. Black as special counsel in the case of The United States, vs. Vincent P. Gomez, and of the amount paid him by the government, if any thing, for services therein—and have to say, in reply that if the Committee of the House desire this information, I think they should officially request it.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar, Attorney General.
            Information declined.
