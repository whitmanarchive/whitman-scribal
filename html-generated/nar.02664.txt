            Dec. 12, 1871.
            Hon. H. W. Blodgett,
            U.S. District Judge,
            Chicago, Ill.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 8th instant, with the enclosed draft of a bill for supplying the lost records etc., and of a joint resolution for the relief of the Marshal for losses by fire.
            At first glance I see no objection whatever to the bill, and none to the joint resolution, except the want of distinctness in one particular, and this I will suggest to Judge Trumbull.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            draft of bill supplying U.S. records.
            Chicago
