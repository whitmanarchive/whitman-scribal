            The President.
            Sir:
            The letter of James M. Smith, dated Charlottsville, Va., May 12, 1869, referred to me by your order, does not contain any such statement of facts as enables me to give any opinion upon any question of law that may be involved in the case. Nor does it state any reason why Gen. Stoneman interfered, and stayed proceedings in execution of the judgment of the courts of the State of Virginia.
            I respectfully return the letter herewith, and suggest that it be referred to the Hon. the Secretary of War.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            Letter of James M. Smith of Charlottsville Va. ag't Gen Stoneman.
