            Hon. William H. Seward,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            In reply to your unofficial note of the 23d instant, relative to the arrest of colored persons at Key West, Florida, who are claimed to be British subjects, I have to say that as soon as a Report shall be received from the District Attorney under instructions which have been issued for an investigation of the particulars, the question stated in your letter of the 12th ultimo will be duly considered. This preliminary action was made necessary by my imperfect knowledge of the circumstances.
            With the greatest respect,
            Your obedient servant,
            Henry Stanbery,
            Attorney General.
