            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to inform you that, in pursuance of the request contained in your letter of the 13th instant, the Attorney of the U.S. for the Eastern District of Michigan has been directed to appear and represent the Government in all cases where writs of habeas corpus are sued out in his District for the release of alleged minors from the military service—and especially to prepare a test case by which the opinion of the Supreme Court may be had upon the question suggested in your letter.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            
            Gov't military cases
            Mich.
