            Hon. Henry Wilson,
            U.S. Senate.
            Dear Sir:
            It is not in my power to furnish you any extended report of criminal cases in the U.S. courts. In a few weeks, the information will come for use in the Annual Report.
            I happen to have a statement from the District Attorney of Kansas, of the convictions and sentences, at the late term of the District Court for that District, and send you a copy.
            In addition to the cases I spoke of last evening, there is the case of Edwins, a defaulting clerk in Treasurer Spinner's office, who was sentenced to six month's imprisonment
            
            concerning U.S. criminal cases
            
            
            
            last year in the District of Columbia, and was pardoned, after a considerable portion of his sentence expired, upon representation of his physician that he was in the last stages of consumption, and could live but a few days.But it has happened, contrary to their expectations, that his life is not yet ended.
            Very respectfully yours,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
