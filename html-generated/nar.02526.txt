            H. C. Whiteley, Esq.
            No. 52 Bleecker st.
            New York, N. Y.
            Dear Sir: I have received your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the pardon of Reuben Carpenter, about whose application for pardon you wrote me some time since.
           
            pardon of Reuben Carpenter
            
            
            
            It appears from the endorsement on the papers in this case that the Attorney General has declined to act upon the matter at present.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls, Chief Clerk.
