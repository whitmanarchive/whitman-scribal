            W. G. Irwin, Esq.
            Atlanta, Geo.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 4th inst. to the Auditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Department, in relation to the account of the late A. E. Marshall for stenographic services at the examination of the case of Thomas G. Simms, before the U. S. Commissioner, has been transmitted to this office from the Post Office Department, with a request for proper action in the matter.
            The difficulty which seems to me to stand in the way of the claim is the want of evidence that the service was authorized by any Department here.
            claim of late A. E. Marshall for stenographic services.
            
            
            
            Should such evidence be furnished, I have no doubt that the charge will be recognized as a proper one by the Department authorizing the service. And you will readily see the reasonableness of the rule which compels the Government to disown unauthorized contracts.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
