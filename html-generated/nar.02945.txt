      Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
      Secretary of the Treasury.
      Sir:
      I have been advised by the Secretary of War, that Capt. Samuel A. Foster, Commissary of
        Subsistence, lately deceased, is found to be a defaulter, and that his official bond,
        executed the 1st of January, 18?66, is filed
        in the 2d Comptroller's office.
      I have the honor to request that a copy of the same, duly certified, may be forwarded to
        me, for the purpose of suit thereon against the sureties—and also that I may be
        furnished with an official statement of his accounts.
      bonds of Capt. S. A. Foster
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
