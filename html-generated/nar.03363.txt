            Hon. J. A. J. Creswell,
            Postmaster General.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date, relative to the postponement until the spring term of the Court, of the trial of C. H. Hayden, late Route Agent of your Department, and now under arrest for mail robbery.
            I have transmitted a copy of your letter to the U.S. Attorney for Kansas, with directions to comply with your request, if the interests of the Government will not suffer by such postponement.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            and Acting Attorney General.
            alleged mail robber C. H. Hayden
            Kansas
