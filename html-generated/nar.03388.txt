            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have received by the reference of the Secretary of the Interior a letter addressed to him under date of the 7th instant, by Gen. E. D. Townsend, the Adjutant General of the Army, inquiry when the presence of Capt. Craig can be dispensed with, or if he can be allowed to proceed to join his company, subject to recall by telegraph.
            Capt. Craig, as you are aware, is detained in this city by a suit brought against him by one J. B. Wright for acts done by him whilst acting as Indian Agent in Arkansas.
            A copy of the letter of Gen. Townsend was referred by me to the Attorney of the U.S. for this District, who has charge of the defence of the suit, and I now have the honor to enclose for your information a copy of his reply.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            Capt. Craig's case
            D. C.
