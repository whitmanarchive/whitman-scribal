            Hon. W. W. Belknap
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            Referring to your letter of the 30th of January last, recommending that criminal prosecutions be instituted against the parties concerned in a fraudulent claim against the United States, in favor of G. W. Waterman, I have the honor to inform you that the District Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, to whom the papers were sent with directions to prosecute, reports that he is unable to find Waterman, or his residence.
            If your Department has any information as to where this person, or any other of the supposed offenders, may be found, I will thank you to furnish it to me.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            fraud case of G. W. Waterman Phila
            see p 34 ante
