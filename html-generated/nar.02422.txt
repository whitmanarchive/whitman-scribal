            Aug. 24, 1871.
            Hon. Charles O'Neill,
            1408 South Penn Square,
            Philadelphia, Penn.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 23d instant, asking whether my attention had been called to the case of Lieutenant Price, who has been prosecuted for murder in New Mexico.
            In reply I have the honor to state that on the 14th instant, I directed the District Attorney of New Mexico, both by telegram and by letter, to defend Lieutenant Price, and to see that full professional justice is done him.
            The question whether an officer of the army is subject to local jurisdiction for acts done in alleged violation of the local law, in the course of his duty as an officer, to persons who are also in military service, has been considered in Pennsylvania, and the decision there was in favor of the jurisdiction. The case occurred last year, I think at Carlisle Barracks.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Case of Lieut Price, U. S. A.
            New Mex
            liability of U. S. A. officers to local jurisdiction
