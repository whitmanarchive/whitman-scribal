            Attorney General's Office.
            August 14, 1865.
            To the
            Provisional Governor of Florida.
            Sir:
            Many complaints have been made to this Department of a very serious character against the Marshal of the Northern District of Florida. Will you be good enough to make some inquiry about him, and let me know; - and also recommend the name of a man for his place, in case I should remove the present incumbent.
            A Mr. Lancaster has been named to me. He is a son of the late Judge Lancaster, who was personally known to you, as his son may be.
            I am, sir, respectfully,
            Yours, &amp;c.
            James Speed
            Attorney General.
