            Hon. Columbus Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have requested the District Attorney of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to commence criminal proceedings ag't Percy or Percival B. Spear. He informs me that it is necessary that the original bond should be produced before the U. S. Commissioner, who may hear the case. I therefore request that you will forward it to him. The name and address of the District Attorney are Aubrey H. Smith, Philadelphia, Penn.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            P. B. Spear's case, (eastern Pennsylvania)
            see Ins. B'k B. pp. 22,~74,~127.~
