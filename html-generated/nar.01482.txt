            November 19, 1870.
            Mr. John Smith,
            Albany, Linn Co.
            Oregon.
            Sir:
            Yours of the 4th instant, with the enclosures, has been received.
            I think the intention of the parties was, not so much to distribute counterfeit money as to swindle you. If you were to send the money which these people ask, the probability is that you would receive by express nothing more than blank brown paper, cut in the shape of bills. Such has been the experience of some individuals who were so unwise as to test the matter.
            Information of similar fraudulent attempts comes to us often from all parts
            
            alleged attempt at swindling, in Oregon
            
            
            
            of the country. I will put your papers in the hands of the officer who has charge of the detective system, and who will cause the matter to be followed up, if any track can be found.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
