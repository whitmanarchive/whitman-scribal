            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, transmitting, for my information, a copy of a communication from the commanding officer Post of Raleigh, N. C., dated August 30, reporting the arrival of a detachment of the 4th Artillery, in charge of the Ku Klux prisoners whom the military authorities had been requested to guard, from Marion to that place.
            The complaints made by Major Morgan against the Marshal will receive the early attention of this Department.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            Ku Klux prisoners
            N. C.
