            April 7, 1870.
            Hon. Columbus Delano,
            U. S. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            Egid Etzell, of Maryland, was sentenced, January 28th, 1870, to pay a fine of $100, and costs, and to be imprisoned for six months, for selling segars in unstamped boxes. March 21st, 1870, he was pardoned by the President on condition of his paying $100 fine, and the costs of the indictment,—which he has already done, as I am informed.
            As he has applied to you to compromise the case of forfeiture, his property also having been informed against, I herewith enclose you the Report of A. Sterling, jr., the U. S. Attorney, relative to the matter, as I have been requested by Etzell's counsel to do so. The pardon did not include, and had no reference to the case of forfeiture, and I do not desire to express any opinion whether or not that case should be compromised.
            Respectfully yours,
            W. A. Field,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            (enc.)
            Internal Revenue Compromise Case E. Etzell, Maryland.
