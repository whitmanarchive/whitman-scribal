            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,

            Sir:
            Referring to the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury to the Attorney General, dated December 7th, 1868, asking his opinion upon the legal rate of duty per gallon, under the Act of July 14, 1862, Sec. 2, 13 Stat. 544, on brandy of greater strength than first proof, I wish to be informed if you now desire the opinion of the Attorney General upon the question.
            Very Respectfully yours,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
            Duty on brandy.
