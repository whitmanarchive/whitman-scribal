            Hon. J. H. Howe, Chief Justice,
            Sir:
            I have received your letters of the 22d and 29th ultimo, in reference to the charges
                preferred against you by certain parties for being absent from your post, and
                neglecting your duty.
            It appears to this Department that these charges have been instigated through
                personal motives, and, with your statements, as endorsed by the letter to me from
                Messrs. Jones, Corbett, and Steele, I am perfectly satisfied.
            Your resignation has been received and will be laid before the President, on his
                return to this city.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            Charges ag't.
            justification
            resignation
