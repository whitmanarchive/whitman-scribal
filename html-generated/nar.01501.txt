            M. F. Pleasants, Esq.
            Clerk of the U. S. Circuit Court for the Dis't. of Va.
            Richmond, Va.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 25th instant, resigning your Office as Chief Clerk of the Department of Justice, to take effect upon the appointment of your successor.
            I accept this resignation because I have reason to believe that your interests will be promoted by leaving the Chief Clerkship for the business in which you expect to engage. You will carry with you my best wishes for your success in life, and my thanks for the efficiency with which you have discharged the duties of your Office in this Department.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akernman, Attorney General.
            
            resignation of M. F. Pleasants.
