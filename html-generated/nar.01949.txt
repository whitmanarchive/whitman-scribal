            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell
            Secretary of the Treasury
            Sir:
            The following telegram has just been received from the U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York:
            New York, June 30, 1869—We have captured the McCool, John Chase, and Mabey, three of the expedition's tugs, with men, arms, and ammunition on board. The expedition is wholly broken up.
            Signed F. C. Barlow.
            Very Respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
