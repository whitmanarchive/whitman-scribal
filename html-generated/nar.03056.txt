            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I return the bill of Warburton &amp; Courtney, New York, for services as phonographers, in the trial of a case in New York, enclosed in your letter of the 7th ultimo.
            Applications for pay for such services are not infrequent, and I have uniformly declined paying them.—The service was not authorized by this Department. While I have no doubt that it is a great convenience to counsel to have the aid of stenographers I do not feel at liberty to furnish that aid at the public expense, in view of the limited amount of the Judiciary fund.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            phonographer's bill, N. Y.
