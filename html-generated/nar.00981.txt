            August 9, 1869,
            A. S. Ridgely, Esq.
            late U. S. Attorney,
            Baltimore, Md.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of August 3d instant, requesting to be informed when your resignation of the office of U. S. Attorney was accepted. Your resignation was accepted, and a successor appointed, July 29th, 1869.—It is the wish of the Attorney General that you continue your services in taking the depositions in Reybold et al. vs The United States, pursuant to your engagement by Mr. Dickey, until all the depositions are taken. You will also be requested to appear for the United States in the case of United States vs. Ullman, indicted for violating the Internal Revenue laws,— your compensation to be paid by the Commissioner. But this will probably be done by a letter from the Commissioner.
            Very Respectfully, your obedient serv't.
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
            Date of resignation,— &amp; further services—of late Dist. Atty. Ridgely.
