            James W. Schaumberg, Esq.
            No. 272 South Fourth st.
            Philadelphia, Penn.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the 19th instant, and enclose a copy of the Act of Congress establishing the Department of Justice, which I suppose is the Act to which you refer, there being none establishing the "Court of Justice." This Act does not establish a Court, but merely a new Executive Department; and therefore no rules of pleading have been established under it.
            Upon examination of the opinions of the Attorneys General, I find none of Mr. Legaré, answering the description in your letter.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            sending Act, &amp;c
