            I have to honor to submit to you the enclosed Report, in reply to a Resolution of the House of Representatives of November 26, 1867, calling for a list of all Pardons, "granted since the 14th day of April, 1865, to any person or persons charged with, or convicted of, making or passing counterfeit money, or having counterfeit money, or tools or instruments for making the same, in his or their possession, or charged with, or convicted of, the crime of forgery, or criminal alteration of papers, accounts, or other documents, or of the crime of perjury; and that such list be accompanied by a particular statement, in each case, of the reasons or grounds of the pardon, with a disclosure of the names of persons, if any, who recommended or advised the same."
            I have the honor to be, very respectfully
            Your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General
