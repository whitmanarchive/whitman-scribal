            Sir:
            The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ult., and to say in reply that in consequence of the delay in the appointment of a Solicitor General, the rules and regulations for the government of the Department of Justice have not yet been prepared. I will see that you are supplied with the desired copies as soon as they are printed.
            Very resp. your obd't serv't,,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clerk.
