            Dear Sir:
            In compliance with your request I have the pleasure of sending you copies of two Opinions mentioned in your letter of the 16th inst. The Opinions are somewhat long, and the time necessary to prepare the copies prevented an earlier answer to your letter.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            trans. two opinions.
