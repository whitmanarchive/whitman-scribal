      Hon. Richard H. Whitely,
      House of Representatives,
      Washington, D.C.
      Sir:
      I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date, enclosing one to
        you from Mr. Samuel Lindsay, of Georgia, defendant certain nol pros requested
         in a suit brought by the
        United States in the Southern District of Georgia, on a post office bond, as surety for one
        Heald.
      He requests that directions shall be given to the District Attorney to stop the suit.
      Last April when I was acting as District Attorney for Georgia I found this case upon the
        docket. It was continued, according to my recollection, at the special instance of
        defendant's counsel. Though I should be glad to accommodate Mr. Lindsay, I would not be
        justified in forbearing to press a claim on the part of the Government, which appears to be
        a lawful one.
      Should a judgment be entered against him, the relief which he desires to obtain from
        Congress can be as effectually granted then as now.
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
