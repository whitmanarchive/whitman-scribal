            Hon. H. H. Leavitt,
            Cincinnati, Ohio.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 17th instant, in relation to an increase of the compensation of Mr. Bond, assistant District Attorney in your District. I had previously received communications on the same subject.
            I have held the matter under consideration in the hope of being able to do for Mr. Bond that which you request, and which his merits seem to authorize. I hesitate from an apprehension that the appropriation for the Judiciary fund, which the late Congress have, (perhaps unintentionally,) reduced, will not suffice to carry us through. In a few weeks, after the rush of business growing out of the sessions of Congress and the Supreme Court, is over, I shall be able to judge of the ability of the Department to make the required advance.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Compensation of Mr. Bond. Ass't U. S. Atty, Ohio
            see p. 546 ante.
