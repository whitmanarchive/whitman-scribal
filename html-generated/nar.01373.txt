            J. N. Morris, Esq.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of to-day is received. The case is one of great difficulty, and I have freely communicated to the counsel who have appeared in it the difficulties which it presented. The last argument or suggestion of counsel was submitted to me but a few days ago. I was employed upon the case when your letter arrived, and was stopped in its consideration for the purpose of reading the letter. I was aware, of the desire of the parties interested to have as speedy a decision given as was practicable, and shared their wishes in that respect. As I have not had any communication with you as counsel in the case, it is perhaps hardly advisable at this stage of the proceedings to go into any more extended correspondence.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            certain law case.
