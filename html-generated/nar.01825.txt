            Sir:
          I have received your letter of the 22d ultimo, and in reply inform you that all that is necessary to be done is for you to transmit to the 1st ComptrolerComptroller of the Treasury a certificate in the usual form that you have not been absent from the Territory without permission during the last quarter. When such certificate shall have been received by the ComptrolerComptroller, an account for your salary will be stated, and the amount sent to you.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
