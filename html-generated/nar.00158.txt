            To
            Alfred Russell, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney, Detroit, Mich.
            Sir:
            The question you ask in your letter of 19th inst. is one for the consideration &amp; decision of the District Judges in the 6th Circuit. But it is apprehended by this office that there is no impediment in the way of holding Circuit Courts for the hearing of cases of original jurisdiction by the respective District Judges.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Ass't. Att'y. Gen'l.
