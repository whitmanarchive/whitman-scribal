            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            The U.S. Attorney for California has transmitted to me the copy of a letter addressed to him by the U.S. Consul at La Paz, Mexico, in relation to matters before the commission for the adjustment of claims between Mexico and the United States.
            I enclose a copy of this paper and add that the District Attorney reports that Manuel Castro, referred to by the consul as an important witness, is living in San Francisco.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Mexican claims commission matters
