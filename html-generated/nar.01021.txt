            Hon. Wm. T. Sherman,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst. requesting that until further advices all action concerning the suit of the Alabama and Chattanooga R. R. Company, on account of the indebtedness to the United States of the late Wills Valley R. R. Co. be suspended—and to say that instructions to that effect have been given to the counsel representing the government.
            Very Respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General
            cases of Southern railroads.
