            Roger M. Sherman, Esq.
            Care of E. C. Camp, Esq. U.S. Attorney
            Knoxville, Tenn.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 20th instant, I have to say that when you were sent forth there was no expectation of such an expense as you seem to think necessary in the prosecution of your Commission. It is a matter of propriety, on general accounts, and of necessity, in view of the limited funds at the command of this Department, that the strictest economy should be observed. This, I have no doubt, you are disposed to do.
            As at present advised, I do not
            Stokes &amp; Beatty fraud.
            
            
            
            feel authorized to direct the payment of Lieut. Clapp's expenses. There are some questions, both of law and Departmental propriety, growing out of his relations to the War Department, to be considered before that can be done. Yet I think that the suggestions which you have made on that subject are entirely reasonable, and if it shall be in my power to carry them out, I will ultimately do so.
            In regard to other frauds, in addition to those specially indicated when you left, you will of course gather all the information you conveniently can, while engaged in prosecuting the work on which you were sent.
            You will receive with this a check for $250, which, in addition to the amount you received at starting, I trust, will cover all the expenses of your trip.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
