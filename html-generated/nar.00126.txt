            Brooklyn, New York.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to say that your resignation of the office of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Colorado, tendered July 19, 1866, is accepted. Earlier notice would have been given you, but that, in the changes of this Department, your letter was overlooked.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Act'g. Chief Clerk.
