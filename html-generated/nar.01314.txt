            General:

Infantry, be directed to report to him at Vermillion, Dakota, on the 4th Monday of June next, as witnesses in the case of William Barry, indicted for the murder of Capt. W. D. Spear, late of the British army—and to ask that the proper orders be given to ensure a compliance with the request of the District Attorney.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
