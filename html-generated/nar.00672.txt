            W. J.A. Fuller, Esq.
            New York.
            Dear Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 4th instant, inquiring whether there is any rule of this Department, or of law, by which you can be paid for services rendered, under the direction of the U. S.C. C. to an accused, I am directed by the Attorney General to say that he knows of no law authorizing such payment.
            Very respectfully yours,
            W. F. Peddrick,
            Acting Chief Clerk.
