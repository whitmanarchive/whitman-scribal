            W. H. Y. Hackett, Esq.
            Portsmouth, N. H.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 9th instant, I have to say that no such opinion as
                you describe has been submitted to the Attorney General. The formal opinions of this
                Department are sometimes prepared by the Assistant Attorneys General. Yet officers
                of this Department who are specially employed in other Departments sometimes render
                informal opinions to those Departments, and the one of which you write is probably
                of that character. I will refer your request for a copy to the Interior
                Department.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain opinion
