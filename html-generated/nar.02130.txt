            Hon. Thomas M. Browne,
            U. S. Attorney,
            Indianapolis, Ind.
            Sir:
            The case of Wm. W. Davison, Abraham Briggs, and Joseph P. Cloud, vs. The United States, pending in the  Supreme Court, in error to the Circuit Court of the United States for your District, has been taken up in this office for the purpose of preparation for argument.  I do not find that any brief or memorandum of points has been received from you, as required by regulations heretofore issued by the Attorney General, and will thank you to send me such suggestions in behalf of the United States as you may see proper to make.
            The labor of this Department is greatly relieved by such assistance from District Attorneys, and I will be obliged to you if you will give this matter your attention at the earliest convenient moment.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow,
            Solicitor General.
            Case of W. W. Davison et al vs. The U. S.
            Indiana
