            Hon. Wm. Mungen,
            United States H. of Representatives.
            Sir:
            By direction of the Attorney Gen'l I have the honor to state that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue again declines to favor a postponement of trial and suit in the cases of United States vs. Mann, at St. Louis, as per his letter to me of yesterday, and that the matter having been informally laid before the Secretary of the Treasury, this morning, he has declined to modify the action of the commissioner—and, in view of the large discretion confided by law to these officers in internal revenue cases, this office has not authority to direct a postponement, against their express advice. These considerations constrain the Attorney General to decline to interfere with the pending suits.
            Respectfully
            your obedient serv't,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Att'y Gen'l.
