            Theodore Phillips, Esq.
            Red Bud, Illinois.
            Sir:
            Your communication of the 11th instant, relative to a tract of land remaining unappropriated upon the Mississippi River, in the State of Illinois, has been appropriately referred to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, from whom, doubtless, full information may be had, respecting the tract, upon giving him a more particular description of it, with reference, as far as practicable to the public surveys of the vicinity.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
