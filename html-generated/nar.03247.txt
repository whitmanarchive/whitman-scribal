            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I enclose the copy of a communication to this Department from John N. Jewett, Esq. attorney of the Illinois Central RR. Company, dated Aug. 1, 1871, on the subject of the proceedings which have been instituted in court against that company for the protection of the rights of the United States in the outer harbor of the city of Chicago.
            Before coming to any conclusion on his request for the dismission of such proceedings, it is important that I should know the views of the War Department upon the subject, and I respectfully solicit the communication of such views.
            I have also addressed a copy of this communication to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, whose Report, I think, should precede any determination of the application to dismiss.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't. serv't,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Illinois Central R. R. case
            see Ins. B'k B. 566.
