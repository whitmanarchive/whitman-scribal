            Hon. B. R. Cowen,
            Acting Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I enclose a copy of a letter from the Hon. J. C. Parker, M. C., urging that a certain suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri. The United States, vs. H. B. Branch, principal, and Johnand R. M. Stewart, securities, may be continued at the next term in September, in order to await favorable action, which Mr. Parker hopes to get from Congress.
            This suit seems to be founded upon the breach of the bond of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and I therefore respectfully request your views upon the propriety of acceding to Mr. Parker's request.
            On general principles I disapprove of such indulgences. They tend to introduce laxity in officers. But there may be, in this case, circumstances of justifiable exception to my general rule—and if such circumstances exist, they are doubtless known to the Department of the Interior.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't serv't,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            suit ag't K. B. Branch
            Missouri
