            Jasper H. Herbert, Esq.
            Attorney at Law,
            No. 7 Warren st. New York.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 5th instant has been received.
            I do not feel at liberty to retain special counsel for the Government except upon information of the necessity of the employment of such counsel either from the Department to which the service appertains, or from the District Attorney—and not them, unless the necessity is manifest and urgent, and within the means under the control of this Department. If you can bring your application for employment in the Caymari case within these conditions, it shall receive respectful consideration.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            question of special counsel
