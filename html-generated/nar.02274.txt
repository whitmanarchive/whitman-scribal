            U.S. Attorney,
            Jefferson, Texas.
            Sir:
            On the 29th of July last, I addressed to you a letter enclosing a copy of a
                communication from J. Hubley Ashton, Esq. Attorney for the U.S. before the Joint
                Claims Commission with Mexico, and directing you to endeavor to obtain as soon as
                possible the affidavits which Mr. Ashton desired. No response to this letter has
                been received. You are desired to make one with all possible promptness.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Certain service required
