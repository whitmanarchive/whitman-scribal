           C. Cochran, Esq.
           Superintendent Mail Depredations
           Post Office Department.
           Sir:
           I acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3d instant, enclosing communications relative to the case of George W. Eveleth, now confined in jail at Bangor, Maine, to
               imprisonment of certain mail robbers 
           
               
           answer to the charge of embezzling valuable letters at Fort Fairfield—and to the insecurity of the jail at Edgefield, South Carolina, where D. F. Grice, convicted of mail robbing, is confined.
         In reply, I have to inform you that I have caused a copy of the communication relative to the case of Eveleth to be sent to the Attorney of The United States for the District of Maine. I have also caused a copy of the communication relative to the Edgefield county jail to be sent to the Marshal of South Carolina, with instructions to take such measures as may be necessary to prevent the escape therefrom of such United States' prisoners as may be confined therein.  
           Very respectfully,
           B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
           &amp; acting Attorney General.
