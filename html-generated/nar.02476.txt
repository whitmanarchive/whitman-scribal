            Sept. 16, 1871.
            Hon. D. B. Johnson,
            Asso. Justice Supreme Court,
            New Mexico.
            Sir:
            This Department has twice requested to be furnished, for use in compiling a Register
                of Officers of the Government connected with it, with the following
                information:
            The place of your nativity, and the State whence you were appointed, your residence,
                and the date of your Commission.
            Register

            

            The Register has been already much delayed in consequence of your failure to comply
                with this request, and you are now earnestly requested without further delay to
                forward your reply.
            I am, Sir, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
