            Dec. 6, 1871.
            Mr. Charles Hooks,
            Care of Col. James Atkins,
            Atlanta, Ga.
            Sir:
            The President has referred to me your letter to him of the 20th ult.
            I had previously received your letter to me of the 18th ultimo, but did not answer it at the time, being apprehensive that any letter addressed to you from Washington would expose you to some harm at home. Your last letter shows how you may be safely addressed. Accordingly, I now write to say that the condition of affairs which you represent is receiving serious consideration here. The enormous amount of crime of that description in the Southern States makes it impossible to work every where at once. The means that Congress has furnished for this work are not sufficient for immediate
            Ku Klux crimes, &amp; c.

            operations everywhere. Unless there is a reformation in the parts which you describe, I think it will be necessary to take effective action there before long.
            Keep me advised of facts, with names and details.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
