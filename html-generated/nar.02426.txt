            Mr. Louis A. Guild,
            Morgan, Calhoun Co. Geo.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 5th instant, and will send you copies, when we have such, of the bills to which you refer. There are no editions of the U. S. Laws in the office for distribution.
            Should you require information about the propriety of issuing warrants in any particular case, or other matters connected with your office, you can probably obtain it by application to the District Attorney, who is John D. Pope, Esq.
            Case in Geo.
            
            
            
            of Atlanta, Geo., or to his assistant, Andrew Sloan, Esq. of Savannah.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
