            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            A letter from the War Department of the 20th ultimo, enclosed certain papers relating to vouchers for horses reported to have been issued to Henry Wood and eleven others by J. E. Montandon, 51st Illinois Infantry, and Acting Assistant Quartermaster, from which it appeared probable that frauds upon the Government had been perpetrated in the matter by Montandon and A. A. Carter.
            The papers do not show in what District the frauds were perpetrated, but from the best information I can obtain
            
            frauds by J. E. Montandon, 51st Ill. Inf.
            
            
            
            they appear to have been done in the Middle District of Tennessee. Accordingly I have transmitted said papers to the U.S. Attorney for that District for his action.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            74
