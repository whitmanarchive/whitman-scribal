            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, requesting that the U.S. Marshal should be directed to eject the squatters upon the Government Reserve in the vicinity of St. Mary's Falls Canal, Michigan; and to enclose the copy of a letter of instructions from this Department to the Marshal for the Eastern Dist. of Michigan.
            I have to request that you will cause direction to be given to the commander of the nearest military force of the United States to the place in question, to furnish the Marshal the requisite military aid, upon his application.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
