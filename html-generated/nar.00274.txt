            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
                Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            In the matter of G. B. Lamar's papers, it appears that they were originally brought to the seat of Government in charge of the War Department, from which they were transferred to the Treasury Department, and upon a reference recently but informally made, the box containing them was unnecessarily brought to the Attorney General's office.
             I have just received your letter of the 1st instant, in which you enclose a copy of that of the Secretary of War
