            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            Referring to your letter of the 10th of August last, asking that instructions be given to the Attorney of the U.S. for Louisiana, to defend the interests of the U.S. against the proceedings instituted by the city of New Orleans, to prepent the erection of the Quartermaster's Depots, &amp;c. on the Government Wharf in that city. I now have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a letter from the U.S. Attorney, asking for certain information touching the defence and character of the title by which the claim of the city to the possession and control of the property is to be resisted.
            If you can furnish this information, I will thank you to cause the same to be transmitted to him.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            defend U.S. in New Orleans case
