      Mr. Thomas G. W. Cruselle,
      Atlanta, Geo.
      Sir:
      I have received your letter of the 22d ultimo.
      The officers of the United States having immediate charge of the business of the Court of
        Claims think that a new trial should be granted in the case.
      Case in Court of Claims
      
      Accordingly they have made a motion to that end, and I do not think it would be just to
        the Government for me to dismiss the appeal, or to take any action interfering with the
        regular course of the law.
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman
      Attorney General
