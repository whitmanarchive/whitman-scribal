            December 4, 1867.
            Hon. E. A. Rollins,
            Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            It appears from oral information communicated by Hon. Messrs. G. W. Morgan and Wm. Mungen, that one Mann of St. Louis, Mo., has been prosecuted for violations of the revenue laws, and that his trial on an indictment is set for next Friday, the 7th inst. in the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern Dist. of Missouri. It is represented that evidence and arguments have been brought to the consideration of the officers of the Treasury having the power of compromise or remission in such cases, and that the day of trial will ensue before a final decision in the Department.
            Under these circumstances I have to request as early information as possible whether or not the question of the proposed settlement has been finally decided, together with other information which may be appropriate, that it may be known here whether or not it would be expedient to direct a postponement of the proceedings in Court in deference to the exercise of administrative discretion in the premises.
            Respectfully,
            your obd't serv't,
            John M. Binckley
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
