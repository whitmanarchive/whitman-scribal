            Mrs. Catherine Weith,
            Care Seymour Duryea
            No 87 Cannon st.
            New York.
            Madam:
            I have received your letter of the 25th ultimo, inquiring when the case of United States, vs. Matthias Haffen, of Westchester Co. N. Y. brewers, for violation of the Internal Revenue laws, will be reached. You say that you are the informer in the case, and interested in the penalty.
            In reply, I inform you that I am not familiar with the position upon the docket of particular cases
            
            
            in the U. S. courts in New York. It is the duty of the District Attorney to press all cases for trial as early as the business of the court will allow, and I cannot doubt that the gentleman who now holds that office in New York will do his full duty in that particular. Your application should be made to him.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
