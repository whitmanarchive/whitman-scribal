            E. C. Griffing, Esq. p. o. box 468,
            Oberlin, Ohio.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your
            official
            
            
            
            letter of the 24th instant, and to inform you that the Attorney General made no Reports to Congress prior to 1870—and that it is not therefore in his power to comply with your request.
            I transmit herewith a copy of the Report for 1870.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
