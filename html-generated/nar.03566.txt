            Hon. T. W. Osborne,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 16th instant, containing an extract from one of Governor Reed to you, has been received.
            I would promptly send the detective requested by the Governor, if I had the means; but the detective fund under the control of this Department is exhausted. Should it be replenished by any action of Congress, I shall take great pleasure, if in office at the time, in spending some of it for the detection of crime in Florida.
            And I beg you in that case, as a precaution against any
            
            detective in Fla.
            
            
            
            slip in my memory, to remind me of this promise.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
