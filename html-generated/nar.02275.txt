            George H. Sharpe, Esq.
            U. S. Marshal,
            New York City.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 5th of September last, with the annexed memorandum of the 15th instant, and the enclosures containing the bill of George S. Ledgwick, Esq. for services as counsel in the habeas corpus case of Patrick Farrall vs. the Jailer of the Hudson County Jail, New Jersey, has been received.
            As at present advised, I do not feel at liberty to direct the payment of Mr. Ledgwick's account. No reason is shown why the services could not have
            certain acc't non-approved
            
            
            
            been rendered by the District Attorney of New Jersey; or why application was not made to the Department for leave to employ special counsel, if such employment was necessary.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
