            D. W. Middleton, Esq.
            Clerk U. S. Supreme Court.
            Sir:
            Wm. A. Dart, Esq. of Potsdam, N. Y. has transmitted to this office your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the case of Osborne, vs. Gates, on writ of error to the Supreme Court. It seems to be a case against the Assessor of Internal Revenue, and one therefore in which it is the duty of the Attorney General to appear for the plaintiff in error. Be good enough to enter it as a United States case, and send a copy of the transcript to this office.
            Yours respectfully,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Assistant Attorney General.
