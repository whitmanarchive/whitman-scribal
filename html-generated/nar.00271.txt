            William M. Evarts, Esq.
            New York.
            Sir:
            I have received the joint letter of Mr. Dana and yourself, of the 2d inst., and have to-day forwarded a copy of it to Mr. Chandler, the District Attorney, calling his special attention to what you say in reference to the preparation of the indictment. I have requested Mr. Chandler at once to prepare such an indictment as he deems proper and sufficient, and to submit it to the counsel associated with him, for revision. I have also called his attention to the preparation of an abstract of the proof, oral or documentary, that he expects to adduce, and have further said to him, that if he deems a consultation here necessary, either in reference to the indictment, or any other subject connected with the case, I will, upon being advised of his wishes, arrange for such a consultation.
            As to the views submitted by Mr. Dana and yourself looking to a postponement of the case in the event that the Chief Justice will not hold the approaching term, I hold them for the present under consideration.
            I am very respectfully yours,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Atty. Genl.
