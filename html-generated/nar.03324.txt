            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor herewith to transmit the account of William H. Bent, amounting to $250, for services in preparing and giving evidence in the case of Matthew Baird, vs. The United States. I also enclose a copy of an explanatory letter, from Thomas H. Talbot, Esq. Assistant Attorney General, having in charge the representation of the Government, in the court of claims.
            The employment of Mr. Bent was authorized by Gen. Sherman, as Secretary of War, in a letter to the Attorney General dated Sept. 27, 1869, the expense of such employment being limited in that letter to $300, as will doubtless appear from the files of the War Department.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            acc't of Wm. H. Bent.
