            Hon. John A. Bingham,
            Chairman Com'e. on the Judiciary,
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I have received a letter from George W. McGill, Esq. of counsel for Wm. McGarrahan, requesting that a copy of a written argument by Hon. John Hickman, relative to the title of McGarrahan to Panoche Grande Rancho in the State of California, may be furnished to the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. In accordance with what was orally said by you to my Assistant, Mr. Field, I send herewith a copy of what purports to be a letter from John Hickman to T. J. Coffey, then Assistant Attorney General, dated June 3, 1861, which, I suppose is the argument referred to in the letter of Mr. McGill.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            (Copy enc.)
            trans. certain copy.
