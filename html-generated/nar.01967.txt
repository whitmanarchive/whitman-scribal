            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 7th inst. submits to me the Internal Revenue case of John Morrow. Without expressing any opinion whether the proposed compromise of this case requires for its acceptance the recommendation of the Attorney General I have to say that I think it a compromise which should be made.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c, &amp;c
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
