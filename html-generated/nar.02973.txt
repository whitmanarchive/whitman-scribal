            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I herewith send to you a copy of an official communication to this office from J. A. Glover, Esq. U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, in relation to the encroachments of the Illinois Central RR. Company upon the harbor of Chicago.
            I respectfully request that the War Department will direct Major Houston, or some other officer acquainted with the business, to confer with the District Attorney, and forward him the information, maps, plans, and specifications which he needs in the preparation of the case.                  
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
