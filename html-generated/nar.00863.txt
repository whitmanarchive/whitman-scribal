            Hon. Montgomery Blair.
            Dear Sir:
            It seems that the officers of the Treasury Dep't. desire the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Circuit Court in No. 215, U. S. v  —and object to the dismissal of the case. Under these circumstances, the Attorney General will not, probably, feel himself authorized to dismiss the appeal.
            Very truly yours,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Assistant Attorney General.
