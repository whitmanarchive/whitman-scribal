            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I herewith transmit an account, of L. D. Latimer, Esq., U.S. Attorney for California, for services in representing the defendant in two cases against George Oulton brought in the State Court of California, and thence transferred to the U.S. Circuit Court; and also a copy of a letter from the Solicitor of the Treasury, to whom the account was referred.
            Under the Act of March 3, 1863, sec. 12, (12 U.S. Stat, p. 741) the matter of Mr. Latimer's compensation for the services rendered seems to belong to the Treasury Department, and accordingly I refer it to you.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            acc't of L. D. Latimer, Cal.
