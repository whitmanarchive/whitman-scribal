            Hon. G. M. Chilcott,
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            In reply to your letter of the 23d inst. (which, at your request, is herewith returned,) the Attorney General directs me to say that he has no information in regard to the fees of Registers in Bankruptcy, except that furnished by the Act itself. The Supreme Court of the Territory, to which the appointment of Registers belongs, will doubtless afford all needed information or instructions.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
            [letter returned]
