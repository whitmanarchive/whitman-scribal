            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 31st ulto., transmitting a letter to you from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, suggesting the employment of additional counsel to represent the United States in the prosecution of John Spear, late Collector for the District of Kansas.
            The disposition of Congress, apparent in the Act establishing the Department of Justice, to check the employment of Special Counsel on the part of the Government, and the condition of the Judiciary fund, compel me, as at present advised, to decline to employ such counsel
            declining to employ special counsel
            
            
            
            in this case.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't serv't,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
