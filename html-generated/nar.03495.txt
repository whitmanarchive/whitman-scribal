            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I herewith transmit, for such action as you may deem proper, an account of William Hildreth, of Canandaigua, N. Y., for Ninety six, 90/100 dollars, for services in the matter of Edward S. Rowland, late 2d Lieutenant 2d Missouri Light Artillery, charged with having presented a false claim upon the Government—and the accompanying statement of Richard Crowley, Esq., U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York. The account appears to have been made out against the War Department.
            When Mr. Crowley was directed to make inquiry, and to institute prosecution against Rowland, if the facts should warrant it, I did not intend to authorize him to subject the Government to any expense for the inquiry; and under these circumstances I am not aware of any fund within the control of this Department out of which Mr. Hildreth's charge can be paid. And I do not know whether the War Department pays for such services—but I transmit the account for your consideration.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            47.
            Acct of W. Hildreth, N. Y.
