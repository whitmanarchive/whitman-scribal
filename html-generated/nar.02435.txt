            Hon. Lewis Fullerton,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your extract of an extract from
            a correspondent of yours in Alabama,
            under the date of the 22d instant, has been
            received.
            I shall take pleasure in directing
            the District Attorney to investigate and
            prosecute the case, if furnished with
            names.
            You do not give the name of
            your correspondent. In one part of
            the letter he indicates a willingness to
            be examined as a witness; in another
            part he desires his name to
            be concealed.
            If I can put the District Attorney
            upon the track, I will
            promptly do so. If you do not
            understand your correspondent as
            declining the use of his name in
            a judicial investigation, I will
            thank you to furnish it to me.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman
            Attorney General.
            case in Ala.
