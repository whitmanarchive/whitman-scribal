            Hon. D. K. Cartter,
            Chief Justice Supreme Court for the District of Columbia.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing a proposition submitted by H. A. Gouge, Esq. of New York, to ventilate the Court Rooms in the City Hall Building of this city, for the sum of Two thousand dollars.
            It appears that heretofore the improvements and repairs made on this building have been made by the Architect of the Capitol Extension from appropriations made by Congress specifically for that purpose, (15 Stat. p. 115.) I do not therefore feel at liberty to direct the proposed improvements to be made from any funds under my control.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            ventilation Court Rooms D. C.
