            U. S. Marshal, Vicksburgh, Miss

            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt, through the Secretary of the Interior, of your letter of the 12th inst. resigning the office of U. S. Marshal for the Southern District of Mississippi.
            The Attorney General takes it for granted that you will continue to perform the duties of the office until a new appointment can be made, which shall be done at the earliest practicable moment.
            Very Respectfully, yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
