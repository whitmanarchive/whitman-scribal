            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, transmitting the account of Benj. F. Tracy, Esq., U.S. Attorney
            
            Bill of U.S. Attorney Tracy.
            
            
            
            for the Eastern District of New York for Seven hundred and seventy, 19/100 dollars for professional services rendered the United States in the injunction suit to restrain the work at Hallett's Point, New York; and asking for my opinion as to its reasonableness—and such other action as may be deemed proper.
            It seems to me that the account is reasonable; but I suggest the inquiry whether under the 17th Sec. of the Act to establish the Department of Justice, (16 U.S. Stat. p. 164,) the War Department is at liberty to pay the account.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            P. S. I return herewith the papers.
