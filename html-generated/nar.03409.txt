            Hon C. Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith a copy of a letter dated the 14th instant, from J. H. Standish, Esq. Attorney of the U.S. for the Western District of Michigan, and the account therein referred to of Standish and Ballard for services and experiences in the case of A. P. Brewer vs. J. H. Kidd.
            The account appears to me exorbitant. As these services were performed at your request, I desire that you will examine the matter, and make such suggestions as to you may seem proper in regard to this account. If you agree with me that the amount charged by these gentlemen is in excess of what ought to be allowed for their services, you will please inform me what, in your opinion, would be a fair compensation.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.    
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            
            acc't of Standish &amp; Ballard, of Mich.
