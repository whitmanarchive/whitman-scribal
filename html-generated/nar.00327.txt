            Messrs. Levien &amp; Ham,
            Counsellors at Law, etc.
            73 Nassau st. New York
            Gentlemen:
            I enclose for your information a copy of the Attorney  General's communication of the 26th inst. addressed to the District Attorney at Brooklyn, in the case of John C.
                
                Braine
                
                Brain
                
            .
            The copies of papers in evidence and the propositions of law which were submitted in your communication of the 29th inst. have not sufficed to change the result of an examination of the evidence which had come before this office through the District Attorney, and which was all returned with the letter to him of the 26th inst. The Attorney General instructs me, therefore, to say that under all the circumstances, he does not think proper to interfere in the prosecution, at this stage.
            Respectfully,
            Your obedient serv't.
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
