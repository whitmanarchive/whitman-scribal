           Phales A. Liuthicum, Esq.
           57 Livingston st.
           Baltimore, Md.
           Sir:
           Your letter of yesterday is received. Any claim of Mrs. Person, as her husband's representative, should be made to the State Department, or the Treasury Department, by one of which the firm of Person &amp; French were employed in the case of the Cuba. But as the firm were employed as counsel, I should suppose that any bill for their services must be collected and accounted for by the surviving partner, and would be payable only to him.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Bill, &amp;c
