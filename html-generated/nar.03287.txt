            T. H. Talbot, Esq.
            Ass't. Attorney General.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 22d instant, I have to say that under your statement of the question involved in the cases No. 154, Azariah Minns, Administrator of Redwine, and No. 418, Andrew M. Ross, administrator of Morrell, now on appeal to the Supreme Court from the Court of Claims, I see no reason for the further prosecution of the appeals, and you can provide for withdrawing them.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            case 154 stop suit.
