            Messrs. Binst &amp; Binst,
            Charleston, S. C.
            Sirs:
            In answer to yours of the 11th instant, I can only say that I do not understand what the Consul at Bremen means when he says that the fact of inheritance, in such cases as you state, is recognized by the two governments, of their citizens, to property. I am not aware that the Government of the United States attempts to control the laws of the several States on the subject of descent, and devise of real estate.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain case, S. C.
