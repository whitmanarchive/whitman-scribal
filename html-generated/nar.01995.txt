            Henry A. Gouge, Esq.
            New York.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to inform you that he has received, through the reference of Judge Cartter, your proposition to ventilate the Court Rooms in the City Hall Building of this city, for the sum of Two thousand dollars—and to say that there is no fund under his control out of which to defray the expenses thereof; and he cannot therefore direct the improvements to be made.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
            
            ventilation Court rooms D. C.
