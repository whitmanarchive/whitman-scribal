            Sir:
            The President has referred to me your letter to him of the 22d ultimo, applying for an appointment as U.S. Commissioner for the Northern District of Georgia.
            In reply I have only to say
            letter, &amp;c.
            
            
            
            that such appointments are not made by the President, but by the U.S. Courts.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
