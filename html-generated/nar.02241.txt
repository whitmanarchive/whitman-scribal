            U. S. Attorney,
            Austin, Texas.
            Sir:
            Reports have come to this Department that bodies of men have lately been assembled on and near the left bank of the Rio Grande for the purpose of carrying on military expeditions against Mexico.
            You will, as far as practicable, inform yourself concerning the facts, and if you discover that the Neutrality Laws of the United States have been violated in your District, you will prosecute the guilty parties.
            You can probably obtain information upon the subject from the officers of the Army of the United
                invasion Mexican border
                139
            
            
            
            States within your District.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
