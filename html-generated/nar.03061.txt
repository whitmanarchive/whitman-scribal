            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            On the 30th of March last the Secretary of the Treasury called on this Department for an opinion upon a question that had arisen between the War Department and the Third Auditor's office, concerning the accounts of officers
            certain opinion for War Dep't.
            
            
            
            of the War Department. At the same time, he transmitted a brief prepared by the Third Auditor of the Treasury, and informed me that a copy of this brief would be transmitted to you.
            I have the honor to inquire whether the War Department desires to submit, in brief, or other form, any views in opposition to those of the Third Auditor,—and respectfully request an early answer, as I desire to prepare an opinion at once.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
