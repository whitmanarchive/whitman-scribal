            Hon. Columbus Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            The Rev. David Dimond, D. D. of Brighton, Illinois, an old friend of mine, has written to ask my aid in the following matter:
            Mrs. Mary E. Burton is a soldier's widow, and thinks she is entitled to a pension. She sent a letter in August last enclosing the discharge, addressed, "Pension Office: Washington, D. C." Having heard
            
            soldier's widow case
            Ill.
            
            
            
            nothing of it, she fears that it may not have reached its destination, or that the application is not in proper form. Dr. Dimond represents her as a worthy woman, and asks me to inquire into the matter for her.
            Will you do me the favor to inform me whether any such application has reached the Pension office, and what has been the fate of it?
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
