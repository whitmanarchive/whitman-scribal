            Sir:

            The object of this enquiry is to ascertain what bail is proper in the case.
            The bond which Spear is supposed
            relating to P. B. Spear (E. Penn)
            see Ins. Book B. p. 74.—
            
            
            
            to have forged with the name of the surety, is date Dec. 27, 1870, and is an official bond of Spear as special agent for the Sioux Indians at Cheyenne River Agency, Dakota Territory.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
