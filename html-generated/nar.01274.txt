           Hon. A. R. Meek,
           Attorney General of Florida,
           Tallahassee.
           Sir:
           Your letter of March 19, inst. is received. I have not before me any request from the Secretary of the Treasury for an opinion upon the question to which you refer, and cannot suppose that I shall receive any, as it does not seem to me to be a matter with which I have any official concern. If I should receive an application from him for an opinion, and should think that I ought to give it, I shall endeavor to do it at as early a date as my other duties will permit.
           Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
Attorney General.
            letter &amp;c. acknowledged.
