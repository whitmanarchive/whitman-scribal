           Feb. 13, 1869.
            Hon. B. F. Wade,
            Pres. pro tem U. S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the Resolution of the Senate, passed Feb. 5, 1869, calling upon the Att. Gen. to communicate to the Senate, copies of the correspondence &amp; other papers on file in the Att. Gen's. office, relative to the case of the U. S. vs. Vincent P. Gomez, involving the claim to the land called "Panoche Grande." In accordance therewith I beg to transmit herewith copies of the correspondence &amp; other papers on file in this office in relation thereto, in so far as I have been able to find the same.
            The memorials of counsel, &amp; other papers to which some of the letters of the Att. Gen. are replies, were returned with those replies to the Interior Dept. or the counsel by whom they were transmitted.
            There are in the office copies of briefs of counsel prepared for the various arguments in the Supreme Court, and filed there, which, I do not suppose to be embraced within the terms of the resolution—and for that reason I have not caused copies of them to be prepared.
            I have the honor to be,
            &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
            Wm M. Evarts,
            Att. Gen.
