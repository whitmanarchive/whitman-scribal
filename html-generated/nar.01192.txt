            Hon. J. D. Cox,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit herewith a letter sent me by Henry Beard, Esq. dated the 5th inst., with the papers therewith enclosed, all relating to a bill in equity filed in the Circuit Court for the 9th Judicial Circuit, State of California, against Fitzwilliam Redding, for the purpose of annulling a land patent. This bill was filed by the late United States Attorney for California, without any instructions from this office, but I do not know whether or not he was instructed to file the bill by you. The request of Mr. Beard is that the bill be dismissed.
            Will you please inform me what your wishes are in the premises—as the subject matter is one under the control of your Department?
            I will thank you to return the accompanying papers when you are done with them.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
