            Hon. Joseph Casey,

            Sir:
            I enclose you a copy of a letter received from the Auditor for the Post Office Dep't. relative to the case of Col. McCoy. I referred your letter to him, as the case is one peculiarly within the jurisdiction of his office.
            I am sir, very respectfully,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Assistant Attorney General.
