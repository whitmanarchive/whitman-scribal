            U. S. Attorney,
            Jackson, Miss.
            Sir:
            On my return from the south, I find your official and unofficial letters of Sept. 13, 1871, which on the 18th of that month were answered by the Solicitor General, reserving a final answer until my return.
            Will you be kind enough to inform me for what sum you can get such assistance as you need in the enforcement of the Ku Klux cases?
                Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                        
            assistance to U. S. Attorney
            Jackson Miss.
