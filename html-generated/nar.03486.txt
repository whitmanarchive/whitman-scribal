            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I herewith transmit the copy of a part of a letter received at this Department from Mr. Corbin, the U.S. Attorney for South Carolina, suggesting the importance of the presence of Major Merrill at Columbia, during the trial of the cases under the Enforcement Law—and I respectfully
            
            Major Merrill's presence requested
            
            
            
            request that if consistent with the rules of the military service, a direction may be given for the presence of Major Merrill at Columbia on that occasion.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
