            Natchez, Miss.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 13th instant, and have referred it to the office of this Department having special charge of the Cotton claims, who will probably communicate with you upon the subject.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman, Attorney Gen'l.
