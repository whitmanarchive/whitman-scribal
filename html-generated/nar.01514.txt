           December 5, 1870.
            Hon. R. S. Greene,
            Asso. Justice of Washington Terr.
            Olympia, W. T.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 17th ultimo. It fails to give me the information which I desired, to wit: the exact time for which you wish leave of absence from your Territory. Regarding the absence of Territorial Judges from their Districts as very disadvantageous to the public service, I do not feel at liberty to authorize it except for good reason and for a specific time. I appreciate
            
                leave of absence.
            
            
            the reasons which you offer, and, therefore, allow a leave of absence from the 20th of December instant to the 15th of March next. This absence is for a term unusually long, and is only allowed in consequence of the peculiar domestic reasons which you urge.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
