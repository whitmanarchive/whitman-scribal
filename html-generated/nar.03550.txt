            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing one to you from Ira Ayer, Jr. Special Treasury Agent, in which he recommends a nolle prosequi in the case of the indictment in the U.S. District Court of Virginia against Patrick McDonough.
            The matter has been referred to the District Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for his report.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman
            Attorney General
            
            Pat McDonough—Va.
