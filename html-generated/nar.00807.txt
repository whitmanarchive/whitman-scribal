            Hon. B. F. Butler, and
            Hon Caleb Cushing.
            Gentlemen:
            In pursuance of the intimation which I gave you in our personal interview on Saturday last, I beg to say that I intend, on Friday next, at the opening of the Supreme Court on that day, to dismiss the confiscation cases from the Eastern Dist. of Louisiana. I give you this notice in consequence of your having appeared in the cases in the interest of the informer.
            I have the honor, &amp;c &amp;c. &amp;c.
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
            
            Louisiana confiscation cases.
