            Fox Lake, Lodge Co.
            Wisconsin.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 3d instant, asking for information as to how to proceed to obtain a copy of your discharge papers, the original having been lost; and inform you that it has been referred to the Secretary of War—the subject being one with which I have no connection, and he being the proper officer to whom your application should have been made.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            letter referred.
