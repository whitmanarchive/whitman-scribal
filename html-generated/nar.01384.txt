            Wm. Breeden, Esq.
            Clerk of the Sup. Ct. of N. M.
            Santa Fé, New Mexico.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 10th inst. relating to the Vigil case, and have to-day sent a writ of certiorari to U. S. Attorney Elkins, to be served upon the Judges of your court. I have to thank you for having prepared a complete transcript of the cause, which can be annexed and returned with the writ of certiorari,—with a statement, however, that what is included between certain pages, naming them, are all the proceedings in said cause had since the 6th day of April, 1868, as the writ of certiorari specifically calls for the proceedings had since that day, particularly all those allowing an appeal in said case nunc pro tunc to the Supreme Court of the United States. But as a full record has been prepared, I see no reason why it might not all be sent up.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Act'g Attorney General
            
            Vigil's case
