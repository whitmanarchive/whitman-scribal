            S. R. Harlow, Esq.
            U. S. Marshal,
            New York City.
            Sir:
            I referred your account $1226, special expenses, in executing the laws of the United States against illicit distillers in your District, to a competent officer of this Department, with instructions to report his views. He has done so in the enclosed memorandum.
            
            acc't.
            
            
            
            I do not see that any other view can properly be taken of the subject, and though regretting that the law does not make more adequate provision in such cases, I am bound by the law as it stands, and am obliged to disallow the account. Yet I shall be rejoiced if Congress at its next session shall provide for your relief.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
