            Assistant Attorney General.
            Sir:
            The draft of the bill in relation to making transcripts of the papers in the Confederate archives admissible in testimony, which you prepared, and which was transmitted by me to the Judiciary Committee of the House, has been lost by some accident, and the Committee has requested me to furnish a copy. Can you do it?
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            draft of certain bill—
