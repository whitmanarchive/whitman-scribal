      John Tyler, Jr. Esq.
      Tallahassee, Fla.
      Sir:
      I have received your letter of the 2d instant, and also the enclosed copies of the
        Sentinel. I read with interest a considerable portion of the exposition, and of your letter
        to Mr. Cave.
      I do not know that it will be possible to dispose of the vacant place in Southern Florida
        as some of your friends desire. The gentlemen who represent that State seem to favor another
        appointment, without, however, having expressed themselves adversely to you. The matter is
        under examination, and the suggestions that have been made concerning yourself will be
        respectfully considered in this Department.
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
      vacant place (office) in So. Florida
