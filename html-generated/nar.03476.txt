            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have received your communication of the 10th inst. transmitting a copy of a Report of the commanding officer of the District of Minnesota, relative to the late raid from the Territory of the United States into Manitoba.
            I have the honor to inform you that I have called the attention of the Chief Justice of Dakota to the reported conduct of Commissioner Foster, with the suggestion that if the report is correct, Mr. Foster is an unfit person to hold the office of Commissioner.
            I have also directed the Dist. Attorney of Dakota to inquire into the facts, and to institute new prosecutions against the raiders. I have directed that he apply for information to Captain Loyd Wheaton, of the 20th
            
            Manitoba expedition
            
            
            
           U.S. Infantry, commanding post at Fort Pembina.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
