            Mr. James Ridgeway,
            New York City.
            Sir:
            I am requested by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, and to inform you that the case of the Schooner Isabel &amp; Cargo, on appeal, was docketed and dismissed, with consent of local counsel of claimant. No argument was had on the merits.—This office knows nothing of the facts of the case,—but it is presumed the case is the one you allude to.
            Respectfully, &amp;c. yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
