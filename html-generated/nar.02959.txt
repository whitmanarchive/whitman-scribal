            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I enclose a copy of a letter from the U.S. Attorney for Virginia dated March 4, 1871, in reference to a certain communication to him from the U.S. Consul at Demerara, concerning
                
            
                
            a charge against George P. Baldwin, master of the American brigantine "James Crosby," of New London. The District Attorney desires instructions as to what action he shall take in the premises. The papers referred to in the communication of the Consul have not been forwarded to me, but are in the possession of the District Attorney.
            It occurs to me that it is irregular for the Consul thus to communicate officially with the Dist. Attorney. But in order that whatever action is proper in the case may be taken without unnecessary delay, I send to you such papers as I have received—and will thank you to inform me what instructions the Department of State desires to be given to the District Attorney in the matter.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                
            allegations ag't Capt. George P. Baldwin of New London.
