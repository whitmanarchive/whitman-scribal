            Charles Case, Esq.
            New Orleans, La.
            Sir:
            In reply to your letter of the 20th instant asking for a copy of the opinion of the
                Attorney General relative to the priority of the United States to payment from the
                assets of an insolvent National Bank, I have to inform you that this opinion was
                rendered to the Secretary of the Treasury, and it is held by this Department that
                the opinions rendered by the Attorney General are the property of the Department
                requesting the same. You are therefore referred there for a copy of this
                opinion.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            opinion
