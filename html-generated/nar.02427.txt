            H. M. Bree,
            Anderson, Grimes Co. Texas.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 28th ult. to the President has been referred to this office.
            Most of the wrongs of which you complain seem to be offences against State law, over which the Government of the United States has no jurisdiction. If any crimes against the laws of the United States are committed in your neighborhood, you will do well to make them known to the U. S. Dist. Attorney for that District—and that officer undoubtedly will take measures for a prosecution.
            If any officers of the United States fail to do their duty, effort will be made here to correct the evil, upon proof of such misconduct.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
