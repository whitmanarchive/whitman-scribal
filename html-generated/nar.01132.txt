           J. B. Weaver, Esq.
           Dist. Attorney, &amp;c.
           Bloomfield, Iowa.
           Sir:
           I have received your letter of the 22d inst., and should be happy to answer the questions asked in it, if it were not considered that official propriety prevented. The Attorney General is required by the laws to answer questions of law when requested by the President or the Head of an Executive Department—but not otherwise; and it does not seem proper that he should express an opinion on questions of law likely to arise before a State Court when asked to do so by the prosecuting officer of a State. It might be thought an attempt to interfere, either with proceedings in a State Court, or with the performance by State officers of their official duties.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't serv't.
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            official opinion declined.
