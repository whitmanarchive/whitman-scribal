            T. H. Talbot, Esq.
            Assistant Attorney General,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            After examination of the case of Amanda Worthington, adm'x of Samuel Worthington, deceased, vs. The United States, I am not satisfied that the appeal can be maintained, or that other reasons exist for delaying the execution of the judgment of the Court of Claims.
            I desire, therefore, that you will prepare for my signature the proper papers withdrawing the appeal. If, as I have been informed, there are some small counter-claims of the United States which should be credited upon the judgment, you will provide for them in the papers which you draw.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            case of Worthington
            C. of C.
