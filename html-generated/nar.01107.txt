           December 10, 1869.
           To the President.
           Sir:
            I have received from you a copy of the resolution of the Senate of December 9, 1869, requesting you "to communicate to the Senate, if not incompatible with the public interest, all information in your possession, or in any of the Departments, relating to the action which has been had in the District of Virginia, under the Act  '"authorizing the submission of the Constitution of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas to a vote of the people, and authorizing the election of State officers provided by the said constitution, and members of Congress, approved April 10, 1869"—with your request that I should report to you any such information in the possession of this Department.
            In reply, I have to say that no official intelligence is in my possession, upon the subject,—and the only matter relating to it, and contemplated
               
                Information to Senate U. S.
           
                
            by the resolution, which I can officially report, are two Opinions given by me— the first to the Secretary of War, on the 28th of August, 1869, and the second to the President, on the 25th of Sept. 1869, printed copies of which I send herewith.
           Very respectfully,
           E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
