            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I submit herewith for your consideration a letter from Messrs Reverdy Johnson and Caleb Cushing, requesting me to move the Supreme Court to advance upon the docket certain revenue cases therein mentioned, so as to ensure their argument at the present term. I should be glad to know whether you are aware of any objections to my complying with the request of these gentlemen. I will thank you to return the enclosed communication.
            Very respectfully &amp;c.
            Henry Stanbery,
            Attorney General.
