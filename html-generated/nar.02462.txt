            E. H. Nichols, Esq.
            Arlington House.
            Sir:
            In order that there may be no mistakes as to my position in regard to a rehearing upon the questions presented by the Interior Department,
            p. 225 
            
            for my opinion in relation to the asserted rights of the Central Branch Union Pacific Railway Company, I repeat in this form what I have said to you verbally, to wit, that I am willing to hear argument on any material facts, not considered in the preparation of the opinion, at any time before the middle of next week. If it is impracticable for the argument which you desire, to be made by that time, I cannot promise to hear it at all, in view of the engagements which press upon my time.—But I will promise to review the opinion which has been sent to the Interior Department, and if I find reason to suspect that any material consideration was overlooked in the preparation of it, I will invite further argument, and give you notice accordingly. If, however, I should find no cause for such suspicion, the opinion already prepared may be considered as my final one upon the questions presented.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Case of C. B. U. P. RR. Co.
