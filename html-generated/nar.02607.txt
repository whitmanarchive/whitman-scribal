            John W. Wager, Esq.
            Huntsville, Ala.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 15th instant, transmitting copies of statements of Col. Fielding Hurst and Capt. R. D. De Ford, late of the 6th Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry, U.S.A. concerning John R. Wesson, who is imprisoned for the alleged murder of one Lewis Moore, in February, 1864.
            I suppose that these papers are transmitted for the purpose of satisfying me
            case of J. R. Wesson, alleged murderer Ala.
            389
            
            
            
            that the case is one in which the Government should provide defense. A few days ago, a personal application of the same sort was made to me by Mr. Thrasher—I think that is the name—who professed to act in behalf of Mr. Wesson. I referred him to the Secretary of War, for it is only upon the call of the War Department, which has charge of the service to which Mr. Wesson belonged, that I could direct the counsel of the Government to appear.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
