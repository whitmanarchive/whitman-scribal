      Sir:
      I have received your letters of March 31st and April 1st, 1871.
      The statement of Mr. Vise to you that his explanation, transmitted by Mr. Matthews, was
        satisfactory to me, was unauthorized. It would be very difficult to convince me that it is
        excusable in a public officer to lease rooms to the Government, and receive pay from the
        Government for their use, while devoting a part of them to private purposes. In the
        unfortunate laxity of the times, perhaps Mr. Viser didn't consider his conduct as morally
        culpable. But I do conduct of Mr.
          Vise
         not think that those who are
        charged in any degree with the execution of the law should tolerate such practices.
      Very respectfully, &amp;c.
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
