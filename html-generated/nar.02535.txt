            Wm. H. Bradley, Esq.
            Clerk U. S. District Court,
            Chicago, Illinois.
            Sir:
            Referring to the conversation had this morning with Judge Blodgett, Marshal Campbell, and yourself, relative to restoring, as far as possible, the records of the Courts of your District, I have to inform you that you will be authorized to continue the employment of the clerk heretofore employed in your office, and at the same compensation, at the expense of the Government.
            The accounts for this service should be rendered by you to this Department monthly, accompanied by vouchers of the parties to whom payments are made—and, at the same time the accounts should be verified by you, and approved by the Judge. This employment is to continue until
            restoring records U. S. Courts Ill.

            the work shall have been completed—or, till Congress shall make an appropriation for such expenses.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
