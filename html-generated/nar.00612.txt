            Hon. Lyman Trumbull,
            Senate of the United States.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to recall your attention to a letter from the Hon. O. H. Browning, Attorney General ad interim, of date the 7th instant, addressed to you on the subject of a suit in which the United States are appellants, and Simon Stevens is respondent, now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States. Allow me respectfully to request that you will enable me to make an appointment with the Secretary of War for a conference with you on that subject, in which I might be able to say
            
            
            what seems to me proper in connection with it. My position in reference to the case, as having been consulted in it in my private professional capacity before I assumed this office, makes it very desirable for me that the question now under consideration should be promptly disposed of, one way or the other.
            I have the honor to be,
            Very respectfully,
            Wm M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
