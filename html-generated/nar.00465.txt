            Hon. H. J. Anderson,
            Auditor for the Post Office Department.
            Sir:
            I have to inform you that in the Post Office cases of United States, vs. Stewart, and United States, vs. Le Baron from the Circuit Court for the Southern Dist. of Alabama, the Supreme Court decided
            
            
            at the last term to reverse the judgment below in each case, and that I have this day transmitted the mandates to the clerk of the proper court.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
