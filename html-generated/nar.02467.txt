            R. A. New, Esq.
            Jackson, Miss.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 6th inst. enclosing an account amounting to $200,
                for services as clerk to the Grand Jury of the District Court of the U. S. for the
                Southern Dist. of Mississippi at the late session.
            While it would gratify me personally to be able to pay this amount, I am
                unauthorized so to do by any law or usage known to me; and therefore I am under the
                necessity of declining.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney Gen'l
            acc't.
            Miss.
