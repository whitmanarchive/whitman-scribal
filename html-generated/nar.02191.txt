            J. O. Glover, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Chicago, Ill.
            Sir:
            We hear counter reports as to the sufficiency of the rooms at present used for the U. S. Courts and offices in Chicago. It is represented on the one hand that these rooms are insufficient, and cannot be made sufficient by the removal of partitions, &amp;c., and on the other that they are ample for the present accomodation of the Court under the circumstances.
            Will you give me any information that you have, upon the subject, and the benefit of your judgment upon it?
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Court Rooms
            Ill.
