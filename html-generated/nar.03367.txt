            Hon. J. C. B. Davis,
            Acting Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith the account of the Marhsal of the U.S. for the Dist. of Connecticut, amounting to $229.75 for expenses incurred by him in the case of The United States, vs. The schooners Fanny and Winona, their cargoes and crews.
            These vessels were seized upon information that they were engaged in an attempt to violate the neutrality laws by conveying arms and other munitions of War, to Cuba. As there is a fund under the control of the State Department for defraying such expenses, I enclose the account to you with the request that you will cause it to be paid from that fund.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            Acc't of U.S. Marshal of Conn.
