            Henry Hopkins, Esq.
            Warden of the Kansas State Penitentiary.
            Leavenworth, Kansas.
            Sir:
            The President has referred to me your letter to him of the 17th ult.
            It is impossible under present rules to grant indiscriminate pardons in advance to all convicts who shall have behaved well during their imprisonment. But whenever a pardon is asked in an individual case, the application will receive a respectful consideration. The application should always set forth what rights of citizenship are forfeited by the conviction,— and also there should be a reference to the particular laws which impose such forfeiture.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            pardons to U. S. convicts in Kansas prison.
