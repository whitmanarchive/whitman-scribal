            George A. Hitchcock, Esq.
            San Diego, Cal.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the 8th instant, enclosing an original petition, and a copy from certain settlers in Jamuel Valley.
            My understanding of the matter is, that the case is now before the Supreme Court, on appeal from California. To repeated applications made on the one part for the dismissal of the appeal, and to remonstrances against such dismissal, on the other part, I have made the uniform reply that I shall not dismiss, unless on investigation preparatory to argument it shall appear that there is no case for the United States.
            I will thank you, or any other gentleman interested for the settlers, for a brief of points and authorities.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            case of Jamuel Valley litigation Cal.
