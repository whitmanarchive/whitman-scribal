            Hon. H. McCulloch
            Secretary of the Treasury,
            Sir:
            I have received a letter from Edward Jordan, Esq. Solicitor of the Treasury, requesting my advice upon certain questions arising upon the claim of the owners of the Steamer "B. M. Runyan."
            The act of September 24th, 1789, makes it the duty of the Attorney General "to give his advice and opinion upon questions of Law when required by the President of the United States, or when requested by the Heads of any of the Departments."
            My predecessors have repeatedly declined to give opinions at the instance of other officers than those mentioned in that act,— and I deem it proper to conform to the precedent which they have established.
            I have returned the papers to Mr. Jordan, the Solicitor. Should you desire my opinion upon the law of the case, it will afford me pleasure to consider the questions involved, and communicate to my views
            
            in regard to them.
            I have the honor to be,
            yours respectfully,
            OH BrowningO. H. Browning
            Attorney General ad interim
