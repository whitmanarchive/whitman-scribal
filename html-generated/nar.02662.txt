            Mr. Thomas Bonner, Jr.
            Ashland, Clay Co. Ala.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 1st inst. to the President has been by him referred to me.
            If the outrage of which you speak can be reached by the laws of the United States, the proper person to institute a prosecution is the U.S. District Attorney. That officer for the Southern District of Alabama is J. P. Southworth, of Mobile; for the Middle and Northern Districts, John A. Minnis, Esq. of Montgomery.
            Not knowing in which District your county lies, I cannot tell which one of these you should address. But you will be able to determine, and I recommend that you address him at once, stating the facts, and the names of witnesses.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            outrages in Ala
