            Hon. Wm. F. Turner,
            No. 904 F street,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 14th inst. is received.
            Upon examining the papers which you desire to inspect, I find among them a very long document purporting to be your answer to the charges against you, and reciting that you had received a copy of those charges from the Attorney General's Office. This answer is dated March 30, 1870.
            Under these circumstances, I am at a loss to see that any good end can be accomplished by a further inspection of the charges—and therefore decline to accede to your request.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            request declined
