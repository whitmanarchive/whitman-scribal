            I have directed Archibald Stirling, Jr. Esq. the U.S. Attorney for Maryland to appear for the defence, and will thank you to communicate this information to Mr. Rollins.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            Binckley ag't Rollins.
