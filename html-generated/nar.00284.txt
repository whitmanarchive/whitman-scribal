            Hon. William H. Seward,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            In response to your inquiry of yesterday, at the instance of the Minister of the Netherlands, I have the honor to inform you that the case of the United States, vs. the Brig Gezina Heligouda, has not yet been decided by the Supreme Court, but is on the docket for the coming term, No. 58.
            Respectfully
            Your obedient servant,
            Henry Stanbery.
