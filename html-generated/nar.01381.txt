           June 18, 1870.
            To his Excellency Harrison Reed,
            Governor of Florida,
            Tallahassee, Fla.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 8th of February last, and your telegram of the 19th of February last, in which you ask for the immediate removal of Horatio Bisbee, Jr. from the office of U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida. The reasons you give for his removal are that, as you say, he has proved himself faithless and corrupt, and has used his official position to embarrass the State Government and the Republican party in Florida—and in your telegram, that he is vicious and incompetent, and uses his office for malicious purposes, and is now threatening indictments against men for sustaining you and the Republican
                charges ag't U. S. Att'y H. Bisbee. 
            
            
            administration. You refer in your letter to reports of agents of the Treasury Department. I will thank you to send me specifically, and in detail, a statement of the charges you make against Mr. Bisbee.  
            Very respectfully,
            your obd't serv't,
            W. A. Field,
            Act'g Attorney Genl.
