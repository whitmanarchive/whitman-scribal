            Hon. J. M. Schofield,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            After my letter of yesterday, relative to the case of United States, vs. Stevens, on appeal in the Supreme Court, I received your favor of the 1st instant, enclosing matter to the same point, as you laid it before me under date of
                
                the 29th. The circumstances which I mentioned in my former letter on this subject, however, render it practically inexpedient for me to act upon the case at present.
            Respectfully, your obedient serv't,
            OH BrowningO. H. Browning
            Attorney General ad interim.
