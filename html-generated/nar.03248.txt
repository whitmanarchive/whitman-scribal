            To the President.
            Sir:
            Senator Stewart has filed in this office additional papers upon the subject of the Judges in Utah. I send you herewith a digest of them, supposing that you would not care to peruse the voluminous originals.
            I do not think that these papers substantially vary the case from what it was at the time of your action upon it several weeks ago.
            Since that action, papers have been filed remonstrating against the removal of the Judges. Among them was one from Senator Wright, of Iowa, &amp; one from Mr. Poland, of the House of Representatives.
            Mr. Stewart says that the parties in the litigation in which he is interested have agreed to submit it to the arbitration, and therefore he withdraws it from the courts; but that he is still desirous, upon public grounds, that the Judges should be removed.
            The best judgment which I can form upon the matter is this: that while it is possible that the Judges have become involved in mining interests to a greater extent than was wise, in view of the amount of litigation affecting such interests, yet there is no evidence of official corruption or partiality—and I think that it would not be a wholesome
            the U.S. Judges in Utah.
            removal not recommended
            
            
            
            precedent to remove Judges, (except in a clear case of official demerit,) at the instance of litigants, or their attorneys.
            Very respectfully
            A. T. Akerman, Attorney General.
