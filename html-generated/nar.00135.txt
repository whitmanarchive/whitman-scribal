            Jas. F. Linn, Esq.
            Lewisburg, Union Co. Penn
            Sir:
            Your letter of 10th inst. is rec'd. This office cannot at present make any engagement in regard to the submission of No. 306. as proposed. The cases under preparation are too numerous to allow the taking up now, or for some time to come, of a cause so far off as No. 306.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Assistant Att'y Gen'l.
