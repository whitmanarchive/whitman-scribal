            Gen. B. W. Brice,
            Paymaster General,
            Washington, D. C.
            Dear Sir:
            Judge Pierrepont, counsel for Polhaimus and Jackson, has, by telegram, urged me, on the ground of newly discovered facts, to withdraw the direction previously given to the District Attorney to prefer a bill at once against those parties. I have declined previous applications of the same sort, resting on more general grounds; and I have not answered Mr. Pierrepont's telegram, and do not think I shall. But if, upon your arrival in New York, you discover that there are new and material facts essentially changing the aspect of the case, I will thank you to inform me by telegraph.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            Polhaimus &amp; Jackson
