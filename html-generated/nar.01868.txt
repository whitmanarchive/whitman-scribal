           Hon. Joseph W. Fisher,
           Asso. Justice, &amp;c
           Cheyenne, Wyoming Terr.
           Sir:
           I have received from the Secretary of State a petition of certain residents of Sweet Water County, of the Third Judicial District of Wyoming Territory, complaining that you, though assigned to that District, do not reside therein. I have also received from the Hon. Wm. T. Jones a letter from you to him dated the 8th inst. explaining your non-residence.
            question of residence. 
           
            
            Seeing the force of the reasons which have hitherto prevented your residence in your District, I am nevertheless unable to see any escape from the peremptory mandate of the organic Act, in Sec. 9, "said Judges shall, after their appointment, respectively reside in the District which shall be assigned them;"—And I hope, therefore, that it will be in your power promptly to establish yourself in your judicial District.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
