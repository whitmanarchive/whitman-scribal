            Hon. C. Delano.
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst. transmitting a copy of one received by you from the District Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, in relation to one Osterhouse, a convict in the Detroit House of Correction, from Wyoming Territory, in whose behalf a writ of habeas corpus has been issued.
            I have directed the District Attorney to appear for the Government in the case.
            I send to you a copy of a letter from the Interior Department to the Judges of the Courts of Wyoming Territory, designating, under the Act of May 12, 1864, the Detroit House of Correction as a place of confinement of such offenders. It was found among the records transferred from the Department of the Interior to this.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                
            U.S. convict Osterhouse Mich.
