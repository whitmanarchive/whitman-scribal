            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit herewith a letter from Messrs. Beebe, Donohue &amp; Cooke, of New York, dated the 19th inst., asking the discontinuance of proceedings in the U. S. District for the Southern District of New York, against the steam-tugs R. L. Mayher, H. M. Cool, and J. Chase, seized at the same time with the "Catherine Whiting," and for alleged complicity with her.
            I will thank you to return the letter enclosed, with an expression of your wishes as to those proceedings.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Discontinuance of suit in N. Y.
