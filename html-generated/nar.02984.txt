            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23d instant, enclosing the copy of a letter from his Excellency the Governor of Texas, and of a letter to him from Mr. Edward Dougherty, of Brownsville in that State, who offers to render service in obtaining testimony relative to the claims of Mexican citizens against the United States, upon the payment of a specified retainer.
            The business of obtaining such testimony has been undertaken by Mr.                
                
            certain testimony offered relative to Mexican claims
            
            
                
                Partridge, who some time ago left this city for Texas and Mexico, upon that errand. I respectfully suggest that until his report,—or some other evidence that efforts in that direction are necessary—shall be received, it is inexpedient to subject the Government to additional expense in the matter.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
