            Rev. Garret Haubenberk
            Norwalk, Conn.
            Dear Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 19th instant.
            You are entirely mistaken if you
            suppose that any irritation occasioned
            by what seemed to be an importunate
            and unnecessary presentation of the case
            of Charles A. Willard, would in any
            degree affect my official action in
            that matter. I judge his case upon
            its merits as they appear in the papers
            on file. Thus judging it, I have
            not been able to bring myself to believe
            that he ought to be pardoned. Your
            convictions founded no doubt in great
            measure upon your private knowledge
            of the prisoner, and good will
            for him, I have not been able to
            adopt. The official history of the
            case satisfied me that he was guilty.
            Perhaps it is not possible
            for one in your circumstances to view
            such cases as they appear to one in
            my circumstances. I am obliged to
            
            Chas. A. Willard.
            Conn
            
            
            consider the effect of a pardon, not
            only upon the individual concerned, and
            his immediate friends, but as a precedent,
            and as a rule of official action in
            other cases. If the principles upon
            which alone a pardon could be
            granted in Willard's case, should
            furnish a rule for general action,
            the United States criminal law would
            become an idle ceremony. It would
            be easy, in a majority of crimes, to
            make out as plausible a show of
            grounds for pardon, as have been
            furnished in his. Of course I do
            not question the conscientiousness with
            which you have come to an opinion
            favorable to his innocence. But, as
            I have already hinted, that opinion
            must in some measure have been
            induced by your personal knowledge
            of the man, and your personal sympathy
            for him—considerations by which
            I am not at liberty to be swayed.
            I might further say that the irritation
            which I may have manifested
            when you were last in the office was
            occasioned by what seemed to me an unreasonable
            importunity on your part,
            not sufficiently considerate of the very
            heavy pressure upon the time and
            thoughts of an occupant of this office,
            which its necessary business imposes. If I were to bestow upon all matters
            that come before me, the time and attention
            which I had already given to the case of
            Willard, not one twentieth of the business
            of the office would be done. And after
            
            122
            
            
            so disproportioned a share of attention
            given to it, and which was cheerfully
            given, (on account of my respect for the
            conscientious interest which you seemed
            to take in the matter) it was unreasonable
            to press it further upon my attention
            in a mode which would command
            much more time than the written statements
            which I promised to consider, would
            require.  But this was only a passing
            impulse on my part, and I desire you
            to feel that I retain no unkindness towards
            you.
            Now, in answer to your question,
            what more is necessary? I can only say
            that if any additional facts are shown
            me, tending to establish Willard's innocence,
            I shall consider them with the
            greatest pleasure, and shall be glad if
            they can bring my mind to a conviction
            of his innocence. In that case I shall
            most cheerfully recommend his pardon.
            But a mere repetition of the statements
            already made, or the mere addition of
            respectable names to the list of petitioners,
            will not produce a change in my
            views.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
