            Hon. Joseph S. Wilson,
            Commissioner of the General Land Office.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 14th instant relative to the private land claim of California, known as the "Suerto en Dolores" has been received. At the request of the Hon. John Conness, Senator from California, I desire to inform you that it is proposed by certain adverse claimants to ask the Attorney General for some direction looking to the institution of judicial proceedings for the vacation of the confirmatory decree, and to submit documents in evidence in
            
            
            support of that application.
            Respectfully, your obd't serv't,
            J Hubley Ashton,
            Acting Attorney General.
