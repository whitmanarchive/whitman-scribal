            John A. Minnis Esq.
            U.S. Attorney,
            Montgomery, Ala.
            Sir:
            On account of absence I have been unable to make earlier acknowledgment of your letters of Sept. 19th and Oct. 13th, in relation to Ku Klux prosecutions.
            In view of the multitude of cases of this description in the Southern States, I am unable to attempt a particular supervision of each one. I can only say that I am glad to have reports of all material facts, and for a vigorous and energetic prosecution of the cases must depend upon the District Attorneys. Aware of the difficulties under which they labor, I should be glad to give them particular assistance, at least
                
            Alabama Ku Klux.
                
            
                
            by way of counsel in each case, but this is physically impossible. The cases are running up into hundreds, and will soon reach thousands.
            I am glad to observe your zeal, and this, I trust may never flag as long as the crimes exist, though, of course, it should be guided by discretion. The Government in these matters is not vindictive, and wishes to worry no citizen unnecessarily—but it expects from all its officers the most energetic efforts to bring these marauders to justice.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
