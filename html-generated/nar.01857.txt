           Mr. G. Cottingham,
           Emery st. Jersey City, N. J.
           Sir:
           I have received your letter of the 2d instant, and . . . . . . . . . the papers enclosed. I cannot furnish you with a copy of your pardon because pardons are not recorded in this office, but in the Department of State.
           The rules of the office do not allow me to give opinions on legal questions at the instance of private parties. I will only say, therefore that the general effect of a pardon is to place a man, in contemplation of law, as if he had never committed the offence. But there may be some peculiarity of the law of New Jersey which makes this rule inoperative in that State,— and I advise you to consult some competent lawyer of that State upon the subject.
           Very respectfully,
           A. T. Akerman,
           Attorney General.
            Opinion &amp; copy of pardon declined.
