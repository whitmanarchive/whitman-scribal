            John H. Purnell, Esq.
            Opelika, Ala.
            Sir:
            Your letter to the President, of the 18th instant has been referred by him to this Department.
            I do not see that there is the slightest necessity for a special pardon in the case of Mr. Wilson Wiliams. President Johnson's pardons by Proclamation have relieved him from all the penal consequences of participation in the rebellion, and a special pardon by President Grant can have no other effect. If he is under disabilities created by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, Congress alone has power to relieve him.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            W. Williams Ala.
