            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I received this morning from the U. S. Attorney for the District of Vermont a letter of which I enclose a copy for your information. It relates to certain suspected Fenian movements on the Canada frontier in Vermont. I do not know that the District Attorney can lawfully do any thing that will really prevent an invasion of the Canada frontier, if one should be attempted. If such an invasion is attempted, it can, I think, be prevented only by military force. Indictments would not, I think, prove effectual.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            (enc.)
            Fenian exp.
