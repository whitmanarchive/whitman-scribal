            Hon. M. H. Carpenter,
            Milwaukie, Wisconsin.
            Sir:
            The enclosed copy of a letter addressed by me this day to the Secretary of War, shows my views of the proper course to be taken in reference to the bond of the city of Duluth. If the specifications are procured, I will immediately hand them to you.
            It is apparent that the mistake in the business has arisen from the failure to consult all the counsel in the case, in all of the steps taken.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
            Duluth canal
            see pp. 68 85, 181 ante
