            have been published of the present series of Irish Reports, and to continue them annually, when the volumes are bound, as I do not wish them to come in numbers. I am not particular in regard to binding, so long as it is strong and serviceable. Will you be good enough to have any books that you may have bound for me stamped "Department of Justice." You will please box these up carefully, direct them "Department of Justice, Washington, Care of the Marshal of the United States, New York," and send your bill to me.
            I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of your Mr. Haynes two or three years ago in Boston, and he very likely remembers me.
            I am,
            Very respectfully,
            Clement Hugh Hill,
            Assistant Attorney General.
