            To J. F. Bailey, Esq.
            My dear Sir:
            I have received two communications from you, having date, respectively, January 28th, ult, and February 5th, inst., marked on the envelopes, "private" and "personal," but relating wholly to a subject to which I have no possible
            
            
            relations, except of official duty, and addressed to me with the usual formality of official letters.
            I now am informed, by your personal note of the 4th inst. that you have some purpose of publishing these letters—and you intimate a desire for my sanction to the publication.
            I have not the least official control over your publication, in your own name, or anonymously, of any thing you may wish should appear in print—but to the publication of letters to me, either officially or personally, I cannot consent to be made a party, and should decline, if I had my choice, any correspondence that was intended for such use.
            I say this without the least reference to the contents of the letters, neither of which I have, as yet, been able to take up.
            I have the honor to be,
            Yours, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
