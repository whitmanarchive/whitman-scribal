            January 16, 1871.
            Hon. Lyman Trumbull,
            Chairman of the Judiciary Committee
            U. S. Senate.
            Sir:
            When I wrote to you last week in response to the compensation of the District Attorney of Louisiana, I did not know what I have since learned, that his actual compensation under the present law is pitifully small for the character of the service required. Hence, though disliking special legislation upon such matters, I would rather that the present bill should pass than that his compensation should not be increased. Yet I much prefer that the increase should be by a general law affecting all the Districts.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Compensation U. S. Att'y, Louisiana
