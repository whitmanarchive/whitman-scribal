            Mr. Joseph Watson,
            Newport, R. I.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 4th instant—and, after a careful perusal, it fails to satisfy me that I should reverse the determination I expressed to you in my letter of the 2d.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.         
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            see p. 47 ante
            letter answered.
            R. I.
