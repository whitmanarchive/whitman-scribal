            Mr. J. W. Eveleth,
            Fort Fairfield,
            Aroostook Co, Maine.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 18th instant has been received.
            As a general rule, this office leaves the conduct of prosecutions on the part of the United States to the judgment 
            
            
            
            of the several District Attorneys, who are expected to indict on the enforcement of the law, whenever a case of guilt appears. Their familiarity with the facts of each particular case, makes them better judges of the merits than the Attorney General. Nothing appears, in regard to your case, to require a departure from the usual course.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            official action declined.
