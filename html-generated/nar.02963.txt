            Gen'l. Alfred Pleasonton.
            Commissioner Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            In answer to yours of the 15th instant, I have the honor to say that I have instructed the District Attorney of West Virginia to institute criminal proceedings against the Forbes, for extortion, if he finds that the evidence will justify such a prosecution—and have directed him to enter into communication with Gen. Cowen upon the subject.
            I have also written to Gen. Cowen, requesting him to aid the District Attorney in the matter.
            I have also written to the
               
            institute proceedings ag't U.S. Commis. Forbes, W. Va.

            
                
           U.S. Circuit Judge of the Circuit in which Mr. Forbes officiates, suggesting an inquiry into the facts, and the removal of Mr. Forbes from his office, if the charges should be made out. His appointment was by the Circuit Court, and I have no means of reaching such a delinquent officer except those I have taken in this case.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
