            Mr. Henry Grebe,
            Omaha, Nebraska.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 12th instant, I have to say that the officers therein named are not authorized to contract for compensation to be paid by the United States
            not authorized
            see p 15 ante
            
            
            
            to persons for arresting criminals. It was the duty of the Marshal to make such arrests, and to appoint as many deputies as were necessary for that purpose. I do not feel at liberty, therefore, to direct payment of your amount.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
