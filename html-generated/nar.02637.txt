            R. McP. Smith, Esq.
            Nashville, Tenn.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing your accounts for services rendered at his request, in the cases of Andrew Maynard and Rufus Dowdy. The accounts amount in the aggregate to $500.
            Before the accounts can be considered by this Department, it is desirable
            Bill for $500
            
            
            
            that you will obtain thereto the certificate of the Judges that the services were rendered, and the amount charged therefore is reasonable.
            The accounts are herewith returned for that purpose—and when they have been received with such certificates annexed, they will be duly considered by this Department.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
