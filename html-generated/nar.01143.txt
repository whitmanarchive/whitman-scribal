            Hon. J. D. Cox,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith the bill of Albert E. Cochran for services in reporting stenographically a decision of Judge Blatchford of New York in the case of the United States vs. DuPuy. Mr. Cochran was employed by the U. S. Attorney for this purpose. The decision reported was in reference to the validity of a conditional pardon granted to the defendant by the late President of the United States. I think the bill reasonable in amount, and the case such as justified the employment of a reporter; and I respectfully recommend that it be paid out of the Judiciary fund.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            A. E. Cochran Bill for reporting.
            see p. 168 seq.
