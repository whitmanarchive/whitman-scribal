            Hon. H. T. Backus,
            Tucson,
            Associate Justice Arizona Terr.
            Sir:
            During the absence from this office of the Chief Clerk, Mr. Pleasants, and while I was acting in his place, your application for leave of absence from your Territory was received, bearing the date September 21. In the pressure of public business I confounded your name with that of Judge Brocchus, of New Mexico, who had been but recently appointed, and who was also afflicted with a disease of the ears. The similarity of the names and disease, with the heavy pressure of work led me into error which has but now accidentally been discovered, and which I hasten to apologize for. I deeply regret the circumstance, and am authorized by the Attorney General to say that if you will renew your application—the circumstances still being the same—he will give it favorable consideration.
            Respectfully yours,
            F. U. Stitt, Pardon Clerk.
            
            see let Book F p 515
