            Hon. Hiram Knowles,
            Asso. Justice, &amp;c.
            Deer Lodge, Montana Terr.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 3d inst, requesting leave of absence from your Territory, has been received.
            The period of time for which you apply is longer than the custom of this Department allows. Leave, therefore, for sixty days, to be calculated from the close of the coming January term of the Supreme Court, is hereby granted. Should occasion require, application can in the future be made, for an extension of the time thus allowed.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l &amp; Act'g A. G.
            leave of absence.
