            Hon. John Pool,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I have received the letter of Governor Caldwell, referred by you to me this day.
            An insuperable obstacle to complying with his request is in the want of the money, and the legal authority to employ a detective. In the appropriations for the next fiscal year is one of Fifty thousand dollars, to be spent under the direction of the Attorney General, for the detection and prosecution of violations of the criminal laws of the United States. But this money is not available now. If it were so, I would certainly spend a portion of it in North Carolina, in accordance with Gov. Caldwell's suggestions. There is no similar appropriations in the Acts providing for the current year.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            letter from Gov. Caldwell, N. C.
