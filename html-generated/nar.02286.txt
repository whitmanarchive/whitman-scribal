            I have received your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply inform you that this Department has at present no copies of the Act of May 31, 1870, for distribution. I propose having some printed in a short time, and will then endeavor to supply you.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
            no copies.
