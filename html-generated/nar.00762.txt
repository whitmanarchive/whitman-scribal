            Hon. Gideon Welles,
            Secretary of the Navy.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the bills of James Maguire &amp; Charles Gilpin Esq's. for professional services rendered in relation to the title of League Island, sent to me in your letter of the 5th ultimo for my opinion as to the reasonableness of the charge; and to say that in my opinion Fifteen hundred dollars is a reasonable compensation for the joint services of those gentlemen.
            Mr. Gilpin has been informed of this view of the account, and has signified his acquiescence therein.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't serv't
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
