            Hon. S. A. Hubbell,
            Davenport, Iowa.
            Sir:
            The Acting Attorney Gen. directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ult. &amp; to say in reply that it has not been the practice of this office to formally accept resignations; &amp; that he has considered your office vacant from the date, (May 11th,) of your letter of resignation. That letter was without qualification as to time, &amp; was in accordance with your determination, verbally expressed to me, not to return to the Territory. Immediately upon its receipt, enquiry was made for a suitable person to fill the vacancy, &amp; as soon as practicable a successor was nominated to, &amp; confirmed by, the Senate.
            Very respectfully yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clk.
