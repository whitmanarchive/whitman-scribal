            Gregory Yale, Esq.
            San Francisco, Cal.
            Sir:
            Your telegraphic dispatch of the 3rd ult., and also your letter of the 5th ult., together with some papers subsequently forwarded by you to the Attorney General, respecting the case of the United States, vs. Olvera, claimant for Cuyammaa, have been received, and duly considered.
            The decree in the District Court in that case was rendered in March, 1858, and the appeal which was afterwards taken to the Supreme Court, in behalf of the United States, was, on motion of counsel for the appellee, docketed and dismissed during the last term of the latter Court, (Dec term, 1868.) A new appeal cannot now be taken, the period within which the right could be exercised having long since expired and no evidence has been furnished this office which will justify or afford a foundation for the action suggested by you.
            The papers mentioned above are herewith returned.
            I am sir, very respectfully,
            your obd't serv't,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            case of U. S. vs. Olvera.
