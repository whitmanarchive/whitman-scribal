           Ben B. Andrews, Esq.
           Jacksonville, Fla.
           Sir:
           I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ult., enclosing your bill for services as special counsel in the case of The U. S. vs. Smith, Martin &amp; Gill; and to say that before approving the bill he desires further information as to the nature and extent of the services rendered, and the present condition of the case. The account should also have the approval of the judge before whom the case was tried, and is herewith returned for that purpose.
           Very resp. yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clerk.
