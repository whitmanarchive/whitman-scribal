            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose a copy of the instructions which have to-day been sent to the District Attorney of North Carolina in relation to the settlement of the case of the "Hornet" or "Cuba," and which are, I believe, in conformity with the wishes of the President, as communicated to me by you. I enclose with them the bond which has been given by the claimant of the vessel, as a condition of the settlement, and a check for $2500, paid by the claimant in settlement of such of the expenses incurred by the United States, in relation to the witnesses, etc. as it has been agreed he should pay.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            case of the "Hornet"
