            Hon. Caleb Cushing,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I herewith enclose to you copies of a letter of the 12th inst., received from the Hon. Secretary of State—and of a letter to him from Mr. Silliman, of Counsel for the Trustees of Fraser, Trenholm, &amp; Company.
            I respectfully request that you will prepare the forms of the judgments by the time Mr. Silliman arrives in Washington—so that if possible, this matter may be brought to a speedy termination.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman, Attorney General.
            (copies enc.)
            Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Co's. case
