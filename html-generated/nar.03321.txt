            Hon. J. W. Douglass,
            Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            Important trials are expected to take place at the session of the U.S. Circuit Court for North Carolina, which is to begin at Raleigh on the 13th instant. It is desirable that the testimony on such trials shall be taken down. This Department has at present no phonographer who can be spared, one of our two being absent on account of sickness. Can you do me the favor to detail Mr. Dufray of your Bureau for this service—this Department of course undertaking to defray his expense?
            Very respectfully &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            request to detail phonographer.
