            Henry Williams, Esq.
            Counsellor at Law.
            Savannah, Geo.
            Sir:
            Since my letter of the 18th inst. yours of the 17th inst. has been received. I shall desire to have the picture made as you propose. The size of the canvas which I mentioned will be preferable, as it corresponds with most of the other pictures in the office.
            You are authorized to contract with the artist for the picture without a frame at the cost of one hundred and fifty dollars. Whenever the picture is sent, with the bill, I will remit the money.
            Very truly yours,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Judge Berrien's picture
