            Nov. 9, 1871.
            John D. Pope, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Atlanta, Geo.
            Sir:
            I have received a letter from
            several citizens of Georgia, recommending
            Mr. L. B. Hargrove for the position
            of Assistant District Attorney.
            I know of no occasion for such
            an appointment.  You have expressed 
            no dissatisfaction with your present
            Assistant, Mr. Sloan, who, I have
            reason to believe, is an efficient
            officer.
            It is probable that this application
            has reference to an employment
            on special service, misunderstood
            by the applicant to be that of a
            regular assistant.  That service
        special U. S. (Ass't.) Attorney.
            Geo.
            
            has expired, and there are no funds
            for continuing it.  And though it would
            gratify me to serve Mr. Hargrove, I 
            am not able to do so under these
            circumstances.
            I will add that it would require
            an extraordinary state of things
            to induce me to appoint an Assistant
            District Attorney without consultation 
            with the District Attorney himself.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
