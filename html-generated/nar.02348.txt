            September 2, 1867.
            General U. S. Grant,
            Secretary of War, ad interim.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the papers transmitted to this Office for the consideration of the Attorney General, by direction of the Secretary of War, on the 15th of April last, relative to the Title to certain tracts of land in the vicinty of Nashville, Tenn. sought to be acquired by the United States for the purpose of a National Cemetery.
            The tracts referred to are situated on and near the Gallatin Turnpike between
            
            
            
            five and six miles from Nashville, and consist of lots Nos. 2, 3, 17, and 18, of what is known as the Craighead property, as laid down in the plan thereof recorded in the Chancery Court at that place—containing in all about 63 acres and 87 poles.
            The additional information furnished by these papers in compliance with the request of the Attorney General, of August 11, 1866, supplies all the evidence which it is deemed needful to have; and from a careful examination of the same, I am of opinion that the accompanying Deeds of Conveyance, executed by the Clerk and Master of the Chancery Court aforesaid in pursuance of the orders and decrees of that Court, therein recited, and bearing date respectively July 3, 1866, and January 28, 1867, will, when delivered, vest in the United States a good and valid Title in fee to the said premises.
            I am, Sir,
            Very Respectfully,
            John M. Binckley,
            Acting Attorney General.
