            To the President:
            Sir:
            In answer to the note of General Porter, of this date, I have the honor to inform you that the Sherman Conant nominated yesterday as U.S. Marshal for the Northern Dist. of Florida is the same person who was nominated June 29, 1870, for U.S. Judge of the Southern District of that State—which nomination was afterwards withdrawn by you.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't servt,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                
            Sherman Conant Fla.
