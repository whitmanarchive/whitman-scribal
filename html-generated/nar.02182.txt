            B. H. Campbell, Esq.
            U. S. Marshal,
            Chicago, Illinois.
            Sir:
            This Department has received your letter of the 3d instant, transmitting an account of Messrs. Ely Burnham &amp; Bartlett for reporting and transcribing for the use of the Judge and the District Attorney, the proceedings, &amp;c. in the case of James Geary, et al. at the December term, 1870, of the District Court of the U. S. for your District.
            Similar accounts have on several occasions been presented to me for allowance, but being unable to find any law authorizing such expenditure, I have in all cases been obliged to decline approving said accounts; and must therefore in your case adhere to my previous rulings in
            certain charge disallowed
            
            
            
            such matters. I must therefore decline to give you account of my official sanction.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
