            Dr. S. J. Wheeler,
            Windsor, N. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 4th January last to the President, relating to a judgement of $200: outstanding against you as a defaulting Postmaster, has been referred by him to this office—and I have called upon the Auditor for the Post Office Department for information of the case, with a view of ascertaining how far the delinquency was
            
            
            purely technical; though it is proper to intimate at once that I do not think there is much prospect for relief without the action of Congress.
            Respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
