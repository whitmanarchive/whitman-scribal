            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a copy of a communication from the City Attorney of Duluth, requesting an extension of the time allowed for the completion of the dike at that point to April 1st, 1872.
            The City Attorney requests that the period be extended until the 1st day of April, 1872. It appears from the endorsement of Gen. Humphreys, that he recommends an extension of time to the 15th day of March, 1872, which endorsement is approved by you.
            In compliance with your request, I have transmitted said copy to the Attorney of the U.S. for the District of Minnesota.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            Duluth canal
