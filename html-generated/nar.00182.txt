            Sir:
            I am directed by the Assistant Attorney General to say in reply to yours of the 12th inst. that this
            Office has no information relative to the case of the Schr. Isabel mentioned therein.
            The affidavit of your client is therefore returned.
            Very respectfully
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clerk.
