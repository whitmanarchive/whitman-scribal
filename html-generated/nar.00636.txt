            Hon. John Cummins,
            Boise City, Idaho Terr.
            Sir:
            The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and to say in reply, that Hon. R. T. Miller was confirmed by the Senate as your successor. He has been informed from Judge Miller that he intends to qualify, and under these circumstances he does not consider it necessary to entertain the question of a leave of absence to be granted from this office.
            Very respectfully yours,
            M. F. Pleasants, Chief Clerk.
