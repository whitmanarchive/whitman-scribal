            Hon. J. W. Douglass,
            Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the first instant, enclosing a copy of a letter to you from the District Attorney of the Northern District of Mississippi, requesting the employment of assistant counsel in certain cases in his District, I refer you to my letter of this date upon the subject of a similar application from Virginia, for the reasons why I feel unable to employ the assistant counsel desired.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            special counsel declined
