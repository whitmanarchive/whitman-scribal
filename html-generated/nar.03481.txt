            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            Referring to your letter of the 8th instant, I have the honor, in compliance with your request therein made, to return herewith the papers relating to the claim of Edward S. Rowland, late 2d Lieutenant 2d Missouri Light Artillery for a horse and equipments alleged to have been lost in action at Morganzia Bend, Louisiana. These papers were received this morning from the U.S. Attorney for the Northern Dist. of New York to whom they had been sent.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            E. S. Rowland
