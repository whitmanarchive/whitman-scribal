            Hon. J. G. Palen.
            Ch. Justice, Santa Fe, N. M.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 5th inst. asking leave of absence from the Territory of New Mexico from the 10th of September until the 1st of January next. The longest leave of
                
                Leave of absence 3 months 
           
                
            absence I feel authorized to grant is for three months from Sept. 10, 1870. This is granted, although it is a longer leave than is usually allowed, and I desire that it should not be considered a precedent.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient serv't,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
