      Sir:
      I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, informing
        me "that the apartments in your new Bank Building are now ready for occupation.
      Upon an inspection of said premises this morning, I find a great deal still to be done to
        the building. For instance the railing is not completed; the second coat of paint has not
        yet been put on the stairway; the front door is not up; and the pavement in front of the
        premises is not laid.
      When this work shall have been completed, immediate steps will be taken by this
        Department, looking to the occupancy and formal acceptance of the
          biuldingbuilding.
      Very respectfully,
      B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
      &amp; Acting Attorney General
      New Office Building
