            Thomas F. Purnell, Esq.
            Austin, Texas.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the President to inform you that he has revoked your suspension for
                the office of the Marshal of the United States, for the Western District of Texas,
                of which you had notice last October, and that you are reïnstated in that
                office.
            Out of abundant caution and to avoid legal questions that might possibly 
                reïnstatement as U.S. Marshal
                 arise, I request that
                you will execute a new bond. If the public business requires immediate action on
                your part, you need not delay such action for the execution of the new bond, but may
                act under the old bond.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
