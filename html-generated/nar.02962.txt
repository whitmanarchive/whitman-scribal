            To the President.
            Sir:
            I have recalled from the State Department, and herewith transmit to you the resolution of the Senate, of March 10, 1871, advising and consenting to the appointment of Bird W. Gray to be District Judge of the U.S. for the Eastern District of Texas.
            This is the resolution which the Senate, by its resolution of March 13, instant, requests you to return to that body. I send to you also the latter resolution.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            request for B. W. Gray's commission recalled
