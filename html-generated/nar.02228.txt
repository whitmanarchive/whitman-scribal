            C. R. Davis, U.S. Attorney,
            St. Paul, Minn.
            Sir:
            At the request of the Secretary of War, I transmit herewith for your information a copy of a communication from the City Attorney of Duluth to Brig. Gen. A. A. Humphries, Chief of Engineers of the U.S. Army, asking on behalf of the city that the time in which to complete the dike be extended until the first day of April, 1872.
            It appears that Gen. Humphries recommends that the time in which the work is to be finished be extended until the 15th day of March, 1872,—and his recommendation is approved by the Secretary of War.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
