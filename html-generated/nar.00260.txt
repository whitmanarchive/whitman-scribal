            Henry S. Fitch, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Savannah, Geo.
            Sir:
            The Secretary of the Treasury has forwarded to this Office a copy of your letter to him of the 17th inst. in relation to certain iron therein mentioned, with the request that the proper orders be issued from this office for the transfer of the possession of the iron by the Marshal to the Collector of Customs at Savannah, and for the dismissal of the libel now pending.
            I have therefore to advise you that an order will go by this mail to the Marshal for the transfer of the iron, as above; and to instruct you, upon such transfer being made, to dismiss the libel now pending.
            Very respectfully,
            Henry Stanbery,
            Attorney General.
            
                duplicate original given to Gen. Cushing.
