            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing copy of a communication addressed to you by the Collector of Customs at Indianola, Texas, wherein he makes application for compensation for the services of an Attorney employed by him to defend one of his deputies who has been sued for acts done in the discharge of his official duty.
            In reply I have to inform you that I have this day written to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas directing him to defend his suit, or, in case he is unable to assume the defence, to designate some suitable person to do so, who will be duly commissioned by this Department to appear for the defendant.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            defence of Deputy Marshal Texas
