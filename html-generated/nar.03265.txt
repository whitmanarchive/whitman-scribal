            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor herewith to transmit to you the copy of a communication under date of Aug. 4, 1871, received at this office from the District Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, and of an enclosure in the same.
            I trust that the communication between the District Attorney and General Terry, through Capt. Smith, will lead to satisfactory results—but deem it proper, nevertheless, to advise you of the views of the District Attorney.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Case in So. Miss.
