            Lieut. J. S. McEwan, 4th Art. U.S. A.

            Sir:
            Your letter of the 28th ult. from Westbrook, Sampson, Co., enclosing copies of the Ku Klux oath and confessions, is received.
            I am obliged to you for this information, and will thank you to continue it.
            I trust you will, at the first opportunity, communicate the confessions, especially those which implicate parties in serious crime, to Mr. Starbuck, the District Attorney.
            Very resp'lly,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney Gen'l.
            N. C. Ku Klux
