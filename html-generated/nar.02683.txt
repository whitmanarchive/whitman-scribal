            Mrs. Sally M. Pierce,
            Milford, Delaware.
            Madam:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, making application for a pension, and to inform you that it has been referred to the Secretary of the Interior, to whom it should have been addressed, the Attorney General having no control over such matters.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
            letter, &amp;c.
