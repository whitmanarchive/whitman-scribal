            D. J. Baldwin, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Galveston, Texas.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter
            of the 30th ult. in relation to the
            prosecution against Jesse Stancel.
            From your statement it 
            appears to be a case that ought to
            be prosecuted with vigor, and you
            will take that course in the matter.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Jesse Stancel's case (go on with suit)
