            Hon. Horace Capron,
            Commissioner of Agriculture.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to request, for the Library of the Attorney General's Office, a full set, if the same be to spare, of the Reports of the Department of Agriculture. An extra copy of the Report for the year 1866 is requested.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
