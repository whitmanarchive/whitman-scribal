            William McMichael, Esq.
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l at Court of Claims.
            Sir:
            Mr. Talbot writes to me that he thinks such a letter as I mentioned to you in relation to the claim of William H. Goodspeed, for services of the steamer "Silver Star," was written by him in the spring of 1870.
            He suggests that it may not have been addressed to the Secretary of War, but to the Quartermaster General.
            Will you search for the record of such a letter, and advise me of the result?
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            the missing letter.
