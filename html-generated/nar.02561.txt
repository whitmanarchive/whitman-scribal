            D. L. Eaton, Esq.
            Actuary Freedmen's Savings &amp; Trust Company.
            Sir:
          In regard to the question of rent for the rooms now occupied by the Department of Justice in the Freedman's Savings Bank Building, I have ascertained that the rooms were
          rent of new office
              
          not actually occupied by the officers and clerks except for the purposes of moving, until the 23d ultimo, and that in consequence of the noise of the workmen, and failure to heat the building it could not be comfortably occupied until the 25th.
           Under these circumstances I do not think that you can reasonably claim rent for any time prior to the 23d ultimo, from which date I feel at liberty to pay it.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
         Attorney General.
