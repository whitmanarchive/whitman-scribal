            Hon. O. F. Strickland,
            Associate Justice Supreme Court, Utah Terr.
            Salt Lake City.
            Sir:
            Leave of absence requested in your letter of the 8th inst. cannot be granted in so indefinite a manner as you wish. If you will specify with some definiteness the time when you desire to be absent, the leave will be cheerfully granted, if it shall not appear to interfere with the administration of law in your Territory.
            On the subject of expenses in the Courts in criminal cases, I will write separately either to you, or to the District Attorney.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            concerning leave of absence
