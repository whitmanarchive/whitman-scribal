            Hon. B. F. Butler,
            House of Representatives.
            Dear Sir:
            I suggest the enclosed as suitable additions to your bill on the subject of testimony.
            The reason for the first
            
            
            proviso is this: in Georgia, by a law passed since the war, the accused in a case of felony, is permitted to make his statement not under oath, and the prosecutor is denied the right of cross-examination. It seems to me that if the statement of the accused goes to the jury at all, it ought to go at least under the safeguard of cross-examination.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Provided, that all witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination; and Provided further that no person shall be incompetent as a witness on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
            
            suggestions for bill on testimony
