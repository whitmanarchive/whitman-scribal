            Hon. Lyman Trumbull,

            Senate United States
            Sir:
            The District Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas having addressed the Attorney General in a letter in which he states what he supposes to be good reasons against abolishing the said judicial District, it is deemed proper to furnish you with a copy of them, which please find herewith.
            Respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
