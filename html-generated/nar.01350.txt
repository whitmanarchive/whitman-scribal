            Hon. C. Delano,
            Comm'r. Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            On the 28th ultimo I received a letter from J. B. Wass, Assistant Assessor of the 3d District of New York, which I enclose. This letter I sent to the Marshal of the Eastern District of New York, with the request that he would inform me of the truth of the complaint made by Mr. Wass; and I have to-day received from the Marshal a letter dated May 30, 1870, which I enclose. Also copies of two letters addressed by the Marshal to the Assessor of the District, and a copy of the reply of the Assessor.
            I will thank you to return the enclosures sent herewith when you have no further use for them.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            (Enc's)
            
            Complaint of J. B. Wass, 3d Dist. New York.
