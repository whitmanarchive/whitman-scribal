            M. Richard Leverson, Esq.
            Counsellor at Law,
            169 Broadway, New York.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing an account for certain legal services rendered in the office of the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York; and to say, in reply, that it is a matter with which he has no official connection or cognizance. He is authorized to approve accounts for legal services only when such services have been rendered at his request, and under his direction. The account, and its enclosure, are therefore respectfully returned.
            Very respectfully yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
