            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            On the 9th or 10th of last April, a Joint Resolution in favor of one Blanton Duncan was passed by Congress, but was not signed by the President. If you have in your Department the Resolution in the form in which it was passed, I should be pleased to have a copy of it sent me.
            Very Respectfully, &amp;c
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            
            Blanton Duncan's case.
