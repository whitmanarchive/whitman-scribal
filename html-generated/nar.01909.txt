            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            The U. S. Dist. Attorney for the Southern Dist. of New York wishes to use in the case of the Dupuy pardons, a certificate from your Department whether those pardons still remain in your Department, as originally issued, or whether the same have been actually cancelled. I understand that no cancellation of the pardons has been made, but that they remain on file, with the order of the President, revoking the same, attached or enclosed.
            Will you have the kindness to furnish me with a certificate of this fact—if the fact be so—with an attested copy of the paper enclosed, so that I can transmit them to the Dist. Attorney at New York?
            Very Resp, your obd't servt,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
