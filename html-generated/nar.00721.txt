            Hon. Richard H. Dana, Jr.
            30 Court street,
            Boston, Mass.
            The court at Richmond has fixed Thursday of this week for hearing the motion to quash the indictment against Jefferson Davis, under the operation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. It will be necessary for you to attend, and I shall hope to see you here Tuesday night, to confer on the subject. Come directly to my house. Please answer by telegraph when I may expect you.
            Wm. M. Evarts.
