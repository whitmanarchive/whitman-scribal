            Clarence A. Seward, Esq.
            p.o. box 217, New York.
            Sir:
            Either the Solicitor General of the United States, or some other officer of this Department, will appear with you in defence of the suit of George W. Jones, vs. William H. Seward, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, upon the argument of any vital question in the case, and upon the final trial—if such argument or trial should occur at a time when his attendance is possible.
            I will therefore thank you to furnish the Solicitor General, (Hon. B. H. Bristow,) with copies of the pleadings in the case, and any other information that you deem important, and to give him notice of the probable time of the argument or trial.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            G. W. Jones vs. Ex. Sec. Seward
