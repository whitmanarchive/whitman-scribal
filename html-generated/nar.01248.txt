            D. W. Middleton, Esq.
            Clerk Supreme Court U. S.
           Dear Sir:
            The enclosed paper was handed me by Mr. McKinney. As the United States are not nominally a party to the suit—but the Attorney General only appears in defence of one of the officers of the United States—no objection is made to the appearance
                
                Sup. Court case 
            
                
                of Mr. Dorsheimer being entered in the case. In reference to who shall argue the case for the defence, that may be made a matter of agreement between Mr. Dorsheimer and the Attorney General hereafter.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Assistant Attorney General.
