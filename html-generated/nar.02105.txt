            J. O. Glover,
            U. S. Attorney,
            Chicago, Ill.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 26th instant, relative to the reïnstatement of the records of the Courts of the United States in your District, which were destroyed by the recent conflagration in your city.
            In reply, I have to inform you that Mr. Bradley, the Clerk of the U. S. Courts, has been authorized and directed by this Department to have all the records thereof, as far as possible reïnstated; and I think it would be advisable for you to confer with him in regard to the matter.

            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            U. S. Court Records
            Chicago.
            95.
