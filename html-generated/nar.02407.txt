            Aug. 16, 1871.
            Hon. D. B. Johnson, Jr.
            Austin, Minn.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 7th instant, accepting the Justiceship of the Supreme Court of New Mexico, and enclosing a copy of your oath.
           
            
            
            
            By reference to the 12th section of the organic Act, (9 U. S. Stat. 450-1) you will see that the oath is to be taken before the Governor, Secretary, or some Judge or Justice of the Territory. I am not aware that this Act has been repealed.
            The salary is fixed by the Act of June 17, 1870 at ($3000) Three thousand dollars.
            The Judges of the Territories divide the Territories into Judicial Districts, by an arrangement between themselves, and hence I am not able to say what counties your District includes, though I believe they are at some distance from Santa Fé.
            It is desirable that you should proceed as soon as possible to the Territory, as I am informed that in your District there have been one or two failures to hold the courts, and business is no doubt in arrears. I think also that upon general principles it is desirable that Territorial officers should be constantly among the people whom they serve.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            appt'm't as Judge New Mex.
