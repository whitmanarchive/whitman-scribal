            Hon. Wm. Lawrence,
            Belfontaine, Ohio.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 16th instant, and as soon as possible will have a conference with the Secretary of the Interior on the subject.
            I have a general indisposition to allow private parties to sue in the name of the United States. But this rule is not inflexible—and if upon examination sufficient reasons should be found for an exception, it will be made in your case.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            letter answered
