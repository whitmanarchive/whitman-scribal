            Robert Ray, Esq.
            Monroe, La.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 13th instant, on the subject of a new District in Louisiana.
            In my judgement, the judicial force of the United States can be advantageously increased in the South; and I shall lose no opportunity for
            question of new Judicial Dist. La.
            
            
            
            pressing the matter upon the attention of Members of Congress.
            I am not quite certain whether a recommendation on the subject would be proper in my official report, but if satisfied that it would, I shall not hesitate to make it.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
