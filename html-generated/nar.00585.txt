            Hon. C. Bashford
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday, referring to the vacancy existing in the office of District Attorney for the Territory of Arizona, and the difficulty of supplying it with a suitable person. In case of necessity, in the absence of any Attorney for the Territory duly appointed, and the interests of the government requiring it, Mr. Attorney General Cushing was of opinion that it is competent for the Territorial Court to appoint an Attorney prohacvice, (vide 6 Opin. Atty's Gen. p. 80.) Should this course be adopted by the Court in Arizona Territory under the same circumstances, it would meet with no objection here.
            Very respectfully, your obedient servant
            OH BrowningO. H. Browning
            Attorney Gen adinterim
