            In a letter addressed to this Department under date of 3d instant by the Secretary of War, attention is called to the fact that on the 21st day of April, 1871, there were transmitted to the Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Talbot, original papers relating to the case of Mervin N. Jones, consisting of a voucher in payment for his services as operator, and his original application for a military appointment under the rebel government.
            The Secretary of War requests that if this Department desires to keep these original papers, photographic copies thereof be made and transmitted to his Department for file.
            
            306
            papers in M. N. Jones' case.
            
            
            
            I am directed by the Solicitor General and Acting Attorney General to request you to comply with the wishes of the Secretary of War in this respect at as early a moment as is practicable.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
