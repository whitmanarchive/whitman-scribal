            He also needs similar record evidence of the legal existence of the legal existence ofthe legal existence of the Fort Abercrombie and Fort Pembina reservations.
            I respectfully request that the papers he desired be furnished from the Land office.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman, Att'y Gen'l.
