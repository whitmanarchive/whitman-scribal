            John L. Delano, Esq.
            Chief Clerk Dept. of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 25th instant.
            I enclose herewith the information desired by you for the Biennial Register for 1871.
            
            Biennial Register for 1871.
            
            
            
            I desire to add that the clerk to whom this duty has been assigned, in making up the statement for the purpose above mentioned, by an oversight, omitted to include therein the Supreme Court in this District.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
