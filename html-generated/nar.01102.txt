            Messrs. Kilpatrick and Maughs,
            Corinth, Miss.
            Gentlemen:
            The enclosed copy of a letter from the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue, dated the 8th inst, was received in reply to a reference by this Office of your communication, and that of James E. Stewart, Esq. both dated the 29th ultimo.
            It is proper for me to say in addition, that U. S. Attorneys are not authorized, in virtue of their office, to charge the government with the compensation of Assistant Counsel,—and there is no fund under the control of this office out of which such counsel can be paid, unless they are specially retained by authority from the Attorney General.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            (enc.)
            Special Counsel Case.
            see p. 126 ante also p. 116.
