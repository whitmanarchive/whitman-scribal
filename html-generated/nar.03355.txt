            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22d instant, with enclosure—and advise you that I have instructed the District Attorney and Marshal of the U.S. for the Dist. of Minnesota to exercise the utmost diligence in inquiring
            hostile conspiracy
                Minn.
            
            
            
            
            whether any such hostile operations as you refer to are being attempted in their District, and to take prompt means for the prevention of any violation of the Neutrality Laws of the U.S.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
