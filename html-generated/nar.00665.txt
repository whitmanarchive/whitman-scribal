            George P. Bowen, Esq.
            Clerk of the U. S. District Court,
            Springfield, Ill.
            Sir:
            Will you be good enough to say whether you have transmitted to Washington the decrees of the Dist. Court in the Cotton Cases disposed of at the June term? On inquiry at the Navy Department, it is found that these decrees have not reached the Secretary of the Navy. It is desirable that they should be transmitted.
            Very respectfully
            your obedient servant,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Assistant Att'y. Gen.
