            Hon. G. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the papers transmitted to me by you in the matter of the proposed compromise of the claim of the government, under the Internal revenue laws, ag't Messrs. White and Errickson of the First Collection Dist. of Missouri—and to say that I approve of the compromise proposed, and recommend its acceptance, for the reasons, and upon the grounds which induced your approval of it, and that of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The proposal is, I understand, that the parties will pay the sum of thirty thousand dollars ($30 000:)—I approve of the acceptance of this amount.
            Very resp. yours,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
