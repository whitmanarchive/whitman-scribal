           June 5, 1869.
           Gen. John F. Croxton,
           Present.
           Sir:
           The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date, requesting him to communicate to you his decision in the matter of certain real estate in Macon, Georgia, known as the "armory" property—and to say that he cannot comply with your request.
        Very Resp. yours,   
           M. F. Pleasants,
           Chief Clerk.
