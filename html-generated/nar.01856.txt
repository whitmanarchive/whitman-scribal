            Hon. S. L. Spink,
            Yankton, Dakota Terr.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the first instant.
            On the 17th of April last, I gave to the Secretary of State an opinion that the session of the Territorial Legislature called by the acting Governor
                Dakota Terr. 
            
                
            of the Territory to be held on the 18th of that month, would not be legal. I have been informed that in the transmission of this opinion to the Territory, through some telegraphic mistake, the word "authorized" was substituted for "unauthorized." This mistake, I understand, was afterwards corrected.
          Very respectfully,
A. T. Akerman,
Attorney General.
