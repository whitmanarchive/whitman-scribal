            Hon. C. Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter to you from the Chief Clerk of the War Department, who asks for an agent to be appointed to take charge of property belonging to the military reservation at Fort Smith, Arkansas.
            In compliance with your request that the Attorney General direct the U.S. Marshal for that District to place a proper person in charge thereof, directions have this day been sent to the Marshal to take charge of such property until otherwise ordered.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            take charge of U.S. Land, Ark
