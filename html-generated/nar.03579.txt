            Hon. D. D. Pratt,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 20th instant, suggesting the employment of assistant counsel in the prosecution of the Ku Klux cases in Northern Alabama.
            This subject has been under consideration in this Department, and I am now awaiting a response to an inquiry which I have addressed to Mr. Minnis as to whom he will recommend for his assistant, and as to the compensation which will probably be required.
            I am resolved to do all in my power to make these prosecutions energetic and successful.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
            
            Ku Klux trial
            Ala.
