            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing copies of depositions taken by the U.S. Consul at Demarara, tending to prove the murder on the high seas, by the master, (George P. Baldwin,) of the American brigantine James Crosby, of New London, of one of the crew of that vessel.
            As you request, I return to you the enclosure.
            The escape of Baldwin will probably render any criminal proceedings against him in the Courts of this country useless. I respectfully suggest, however, that the Consul be directed to make known to the State Department the probable time of arrival of any of the material witnesses in any part of the United States, as well as any information which he may have in regard to the hiding place of Baldwin. On the receipt of such information from the State Department, this Department can direct the proper District Attorney to prefer a bill of indictment under which Baldwin can be tried, in the event of his return to this country.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
