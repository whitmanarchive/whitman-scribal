            Col. Wm. L. Utley.
            Sir:
            The Hon. M. H. Carpenter has transmitted to me your communication of May 4, 1871, asking that the Government of the United States shall take charge of the suit of George Robertson, vs. yourself, in which a judgment appears to have been taken against you for $708, principal, in the Circuit Court of Jessamine County, Kentucky, on which judgment suit has been commenced in the Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of Wisconsin.
            Knowing nothing of the matter except from your letter, I desire to be informed of the nature of the suit, of the grounds upon which the Government is expected to take charge of the defence—whether a defence was made in the Kentucky court—and, if not, why this application to the United States has been
                suit ag't Col. Utley in Kentucky 
                
                
            deferred until after judgment—and any other circumstances tending to show the relation of the United States to the business.
            Your address not appearing in your communication, and not being otherwise known to me, I shall send this to Mr. Carpenter, requesting him to forward it to you.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
