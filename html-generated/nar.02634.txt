            Lieut. J. S. McEwan,
            Fourth Artillery,
            Raleigh, N. C.
            Sir:
            I have your letter of the 24th ultimo, from Westbrook Township, Sampson Co., and am very much obliged to you for the information which it contains. Since writing before, I have found papers which I suppose were the ones referred to in your previous communication relating to Shotwell.
            I have looked over with great interest the copies of the confessions which you sent me. They are of the same sort as those with which I am familiar in South Carolina.
            I shall be very glad if you will continue to forward similar papers when they contain any thing of an unusual character.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
            letter &amp;c rec'd (Ku Klux N. C.)
