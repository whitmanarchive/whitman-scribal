           Hon. H. W. Barry,
           Columbus, Miss.
           Sir:
           The letter of Mr. McKenzie, of the 24th ultimo, which you have referred to me, inquires about the mode of naturalization. I am not at liberty to give official opinions at the call of private citizens—or, indeed, on any body but the President and the Heads of Departments, and officers who are under the direction of this Department.
           The statutes of the United States indicate the mode of naturalization very plainly, and any good lawyer in Mr. McKenzie's neighborhood can give him the desired information.
           Very respectfully, &amp;c.
           A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Naturalization
