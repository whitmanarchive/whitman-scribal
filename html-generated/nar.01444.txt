            October 28, 1870.
            Mr. C. W. Venable,
            Hampden Sidney College,
            Prince Edward Co. Va.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter with its enclosures. It is one instance of a villainous attempt, which is now very common. I doubt whether the
            
            proceeding was intended so much as a fraud upon the government as a fraud upon you. I have put the papers in the hands of an officer who has charge of the detective service of the Government, with instructions to trace it out, and, if there is reason to suspect the existence of a conspiracy of counterfeiters, to follow it up to the utmost, and to call on you, if necessary, for coöperation.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Case of suspected counterfeiting &amp;c.
