            Hon. Wm. M. Evarts,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            The transcript of the record in the case of James B. Boylan, pl'ff. in error, vs. The United States, No. 66, on the docket of the Supreme Court for the present term, was delivered to the Solicitor of Internal Revenue, with a request that he would express an opinion whether the agreed statement of facts should be amended as proposed by counsel for the pl'ff. in error. He has returned the transcript with an expression of opinion that the interests of the government will be promoted by leaving the case in its present condition, without amendment. I must therefore decline to consent to any stipulation to amend the agreed statement of facts.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            Sup. Court case Boylan vs. U. S.
