            Hon. Wm F. Turner,
            No. 409 F. street,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            In answer to yours of the 30th ult. I have only to say in this form what I have said to you verbally that it is not the custom of this office to permit an inspection of papers on the subject of removals and appointments, unless some special and sufficient reason be shown for such inspection. The only reason which you present is, that you desire to contradict statements in regard to yourself made in such papers long ago. I do not think that any good public end will be served by permitting an inspection for such a purpose. Such communications to this office are considered as in some sense of a confidential character. And in addition to other reasons for withholding them, I am satisfied that the custom of disclosing them would subject this office to an amount of discussion and annoyance that would be altogether intolerable. I therefore feel bound to decline a compliance with your request.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman, Attorney Gen'l.
            declining request to inspect papers in this office
