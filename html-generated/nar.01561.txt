            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 16th instant, asking for a copy of the trial of E. M. Yerger, before a Military Court in 1869, and inform you that it has been referred to the Secretary of War, as the record of the proceedings in this
            Yerger trial
            
            
            case is not on file in this Department.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            and Acting Attorney General.
