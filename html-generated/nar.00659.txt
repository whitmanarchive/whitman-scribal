            I am directed by the Acting Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and to say, in reply, that the Attorney General has entrusted the conduct of the business of this office in the Court of Claims to the Hon. T. Lyle Dickey, Assistant Attorney General. Your letter has therefore been referred to him.
                Very respectfully, yours
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
