            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to send you copies of two letters to me from the Hon. M. H. Carpenter, one dated July 19th, and the other August 3, 1871, in reference to the bond of the city of Duluth.
            I think that Mr. Carpenter's exceptions to the bond are well taken, and therefore respectfully suggest that the specification mentioned in his letter of July 19th be furnished, and that the District Attorney be directed to confer with Mr. Carpenter in the preparation of a proper bond,—and in the event that the city shall not furnish it, to institute further proceedings in the court to restore the injunction.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
