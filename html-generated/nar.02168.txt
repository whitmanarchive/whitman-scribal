            Hon. Thomas M. Browne,
            U. S. Attorney
            Indianapolis, Ind.
            Sir:
            I have to thank you for your most excellent and able brief in the case of Davidson and others, vs. The United States.
            On examination of the record, however, I find that no judgment was entered in the Circuit Court et all,
            Davidson &amp; others vs. The U. S.
            
            
            
           and consequently there is nothing to which a writ of error will lie. Moreover it appears that the judgment in the District Court on the verdict is against, J.M. Dair, Abram Briggs, and J. P. Cloud. There does not appear to have been any judgment against Davidson, who is a plaintiff in the writ of error. Judgment had been previously rendered against Dair on demurrer, and I suppose it is by clerical error that Dair's name got into the judgement rendered on the verdict. It may be that the copy of the record which is sent here is erroneous in this respect. If, however, it is a true copy, I think you will do well to look after correction of this judgment in the District Court.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow,
            Solicitor General.
