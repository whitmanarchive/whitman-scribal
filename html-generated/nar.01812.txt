            April 10, 1871.
            Mr. J. D. Jones,
            Vienna, Maries Co. Missouri.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the 4th instant.
            
            
            
            The circular which you enclose is the work of some swindler who hopes to induce you to send him money, under a promise to supply you with counterfeit money. If you should send him the money which he asks, it is not likely that you would receive any of the counterfeit, but only waste paper or sawdust, or some such material; for that is the usual course of these persons.
            But whether you would get counterfeit money or not is a matter of no consequence in the view which every honest man must take of the subject. I advise you to have nothing to do with the business,—neither with the man, with his saw-dust, with his brown paper, or with his counterfeit money, if he has any.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            counterfeit money.
