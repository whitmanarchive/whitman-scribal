            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowlege the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing the account of S. S. Remak, Esq. for professional services as Attorney at Law, rendered at the instance of Capt. Oscar R. Hagen, 9 U.S. Cavalry, and suggesting that the fee of Mr. Remak be paid by this Department.
            While I would not lay it down as an inflexible rule that this Department will not pay compensation for special professional services except to persons commissioned by the Attorney General under the 17th Sec. of the Act to establish the Department of Justice, (16 U.S. Stat. 164-5,) yet in this case I think it improper to recognize the claim of Mr. Remak as a charge upon this Department. The service was rendered at Philadelphia, where there is a U.S. Attorney and several Assistants, and within telegraphic commnication of Washington,—so that there is no reason why the services of the regular Attorney of the U.S., or of an authorized special attorney should not have been obtained. I will add that the employment of Mr. Remak seems to have been made in good faith by Captain Hagen, and that the services were
            
            cannot pay S. S. Remak, Phil
            
            
            
            undoubtedly worth the amount charged.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            The papers are herewith returned
