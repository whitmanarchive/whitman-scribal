            Messrs. Little, Brown, &amp; Co.
            110 Washington street,
            Boston, Mass.
            Dear Sirs:
            I write to request that you will send to this Department as rapidly as they appear, your edition of Clark and Finnelly's Reports, and the English Chancery Reports, provided they are, as I
            
            Library Books
            
            
            
            
            suppose, unabridged reprints of the English volumes.
            Will you also send, as promptly as you can fill the orders, the following Reports:
            Equity Cases, abridged, 2 Vols.
            Freeman's Chancery,
            West's Chancery,
            Cases, tempore Talbot,
            Cox's Chancery Cases,
            Comyn's, 2 Vols.
            Barnardiston O. B. 2 Vols.
            Wilmot's Notes and Opin's
            Lofft,
            Chitty, 2 Vols.
            Parker,
            Arstruther, 3 Vols.
            Forest,
            Wightwick
            I should like these to be good, serviceable editions, in reasonably good condition.
            The Solicitor General desires me to ask you what you will let him have a set of the House of Lords cases for. He has likewise been told by somebody that your reprint is in some respects abridged. I am convinced that this is an error.
            Yours, very truly,
            Clement Hugh Hill.
