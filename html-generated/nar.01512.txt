            R. L.T. Beale, Esq.
            Hague, Westmoreland Co. Va.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 26th ult. I have to say that I see no remedy for the inconveniences which your clients suffer from a disregard, by the present Courts of Virginia, of military orders during the pending of reconstruction, except this: to carry their cases to the highest Court in Virginia, and thence to the Supreme Court of The United States, under the 25th Section of the Judiciary Act of 1789. It occurs to me that this course will produce a judgment of the highest Court, upon the validity of the acts of military commanders of Districts, under the Reconstruction Acts.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            certain case in Va.
