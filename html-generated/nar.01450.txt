            Hon. C. Delano,
            Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith copies of correspondence relating to the suit of Binckley vs. Rollins, referred to this Department by you on the 28th inst.
            I do not think that the interest of the Government, (if any,) in this matter is such as to require the attention of the Solicitor General to the case referred to.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            (enc's.)
            case of Binkley vs. Rollins.
