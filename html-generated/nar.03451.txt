            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing the copy of a Report from Thomas Kearny, Esq., Collector at Corpus Christi, Texas, in relation to the murder of mounted inspector E. McLaughlin, and suggesting that a reward be offered by the Department of Justice for the apprehension of the perpetrators.
            The appropriation out of which you suggest that this reward can be paid, to wit, that for the conviction and prosecution of crimes against the United States, will be exhausted by contracts already made, and I am not aware of any other fund in charge of this Department out of which such a reward could be paid—and therefore it will not be in my power to offer a reward in the case.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            Murder of E. McLaughlin
            Texas.
