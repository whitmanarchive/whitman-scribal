            Hon. Geo. S Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 6th inst., relating to the Internal Revenue case of David C. Keller, of Pennsylvania, which he desires to compromise by paying as tax Sixteen hundred and fifty six, 77/100 dollars, and the costs of suit for a forfeiture of spirits seized. I recommend that the suit be compromised on those terms.
            Very Respectfully,
            your obed't serv't,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
