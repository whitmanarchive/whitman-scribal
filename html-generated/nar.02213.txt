           Dec. 1, 1871,
            Henry P. Rolfe, Esq.
            U.S. Attorney,
            Concord, N. H.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 25th ultimo, asking leave to prosecute in the State Court of New Hampshire a certain party accused of forgery, has been received.
            It appears that the statute of limitations bars the offence against the United States, but does not bar the offence against the State.
            Your letter does not state the name of the party whom you desire to prosecute. The Second Auditor however has shown me your communication to him from which it appears that the party is William R. Patten.
            You are authorized—of course with the consent of the Attorney General of New Hampshire,—to prosecute in the State Court.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Case in N. H.
