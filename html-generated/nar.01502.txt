            S. Hepburn, Jr. Esq.
            Carlisle, Penn.
            Sir:
            The transcript of record of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in the case of Lieut. W. J. Cain, transmitted with your letter of the 28th inst. has been carefully examined.
            Under the special verdict of the Jury in that case, no question of law arises which it is deemed essential by this Department to have reviewed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.
            Thanking you for the energy and fidelity with which you have discharged your duty in this case.
            I am, Very respectfully, &amp;c,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            Case of Lieut. W. J. Cain, Penn.
