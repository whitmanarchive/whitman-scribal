            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 18th instant, I have the honor to say that in view of the value of the property, and the labor of investigating titles, I think that the account of the United States District Attorney for services in examining
            acct of U.S. Att'y
                Omaha.
            
            
            
            titles to lands in Omaha, which was enclosed in your letter, and which I return, is reasonable and just.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
