            Hon. J. C. B. Davis,
            Acting Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th instant, enclosing a dispatch from the U.S. Vice Consul General at Havana, in which he states that an attack has been made upon the dwelling of the Spanish Consul at
            
            
            
            
            Key West by expatriated Cubans now living there.
            I have transmitted a copy of your dispatch to the District Attorney for the southern District of Florida, with instructions to make a thorough investigation of the matter, and to institute criminal proceedings against the offending parties, if the facts in the case will warrant it.
            The dispatch of the Vice Consul is herewith returned.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            attack on Spanish Consul
