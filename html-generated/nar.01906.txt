            Hon. R. B. Hayes,
            Governor of Ohio,
            Columbus.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 21st May inst. addressed to the President of the U. S. has been referred by him to me. I would respectfully suggest in relation to the case of Smith Still, therein mentioned, whether a disability created solely by the laws of Ohio must not be removed, if at all, by the pardon of the Executive, of that State, and not by any action of the President. On looking at the laws of Ohio, I have not been able to find how the disability is created, which needs any action for the restoration of civil rights. I should be glad to receive any further information or suggestion in this case that you may think it desirable to make.
            Very Resp.
            Your obd't servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
