            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            Respecting the case of Ezra Carter, formerly Collector of Customs at Portland, Maine, which was submitted by you to the late Attorney General, under cover of a letter dated April 16, 1867, for his advice upon certain questions relating thereto, I request to be informed when Mr. C's accounts as Collector were finally settled in your Department,—and whether, in the examination and adjustment of those accounts, the accounting officer considered and construed the 5th Section of the Act of March 3, 1841, (5 Stat. 432,)—also whether an appeal lies from the decision of such officer—and, if so, whether an appeal was taken in this case.
            I have the honor to be, Very respectfully,
            O. H. Browning,
            Attorney General ad interim.
