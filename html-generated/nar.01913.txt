            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th inst. with papers enclosed, all relating to a suit pending in the District Court of the United States, for the Western Dist. of Tennessee, entitled The United States, vs. a lot of about 1500 bales of cotton, Gill &amp; Burditt claimants. So far as this is a case under Sec. 4, Ch. 225 of the Act of 1864, and Sec. 5, Ch. 3, Act of 1861, I do not see that it is affected by the circular of March 2, 1869, to which you refer.—If there is any evidence to support counts under these sections, the suit can be prosecuted. If it is deemed necessary that any instructions to that effect be given to the Attorney of the U. S. having charge of the suit, your Department can give them—or I will so instruct him, if you desire it.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
