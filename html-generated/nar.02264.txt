            Dec. 18, 1871.
            C. W. C. Rowell, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Arizona City, Arizona.
            Sir:
            I enclose copies of two sworn statements marked "7" and "8" respectively made before Mexican authorities in relation to certain criminal transactions in Lower California, which have been
          
            
            
            
            transmitted to the State Department from the Mexican Legation.
            These papers have been sent to me by the Department of State for such action as may be proper. The statements are not sufficiently full to enable me to determine whether the transactions described as having occurred in Arizona amount to a breach of the 6th Section of the Neutrality Act of 1818, which you will find in Brightley's Digest, Vol. 1, p. 689.
            You will doubtless find it easy to get information on the subject by inquiry—and if you ascertain that the Neutrality Laws of the United States have been violated, you will institute prosecutions against the offending parties.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
