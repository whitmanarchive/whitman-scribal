            November 22, 1870.
            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, relating to Margaret Robinson, a colored girl who is supposed to have been kidnapped from St. Louis, Missouri, and taken to the island of Cuba.
            The report of Mr. Hall, Vice Consul General at Havana, does not state in distinct terms, that the girl was held as a slave by Mrs. Sackett, or by Madame Bolio, to whom she was transferred by Mrs. Sackett, but I infer from the report that such was the fact.
            I shall therefore call the attention of the District Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri to the matter, and direct him to institute criminal proceedings 
            alleged kidnapping case, St. Louis, Mo.
            see Ins. Book B. p. 183.
            
            
            
            against the guilty parties, if he can discover sufficient evidence.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
