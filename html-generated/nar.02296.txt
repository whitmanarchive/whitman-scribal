            George C. Bates, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Salt Lake City, U. T.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter
            of the 14th instant on the subject of
            issuing warrants unnecessarily.
            I agree with you that it is
            very inexpedient that warrants should
            be issued or served without the approval
            of the District Attorney whenever it is
            possible to consult that officer. Yet
            I hardly feel at liberty to direct that
            Marshals shall serve no warrants
            without your approval, because cases
            might arise in which injured parties
            would have a right to criminal process
            without that preliminary. If it should
            be discovered that officers are pressing
            unneccessaryunnecessary prosecutions, an immediate
            recommendation would be made by this
            Department to the appointing power for
            the removal of such officers. It is particularyparticularly
            important that no officer or
            private person shall avail himself of
            the excitement now existing in your
            Territory to make private gains out of the
            process of the law.  Any taint of that sort
            will very much discredit the administration
            of justice there; and, upon general considerations
            all care should be taken to
            prevent the accumulation of unnecessary
            costs.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            arrests &amp;c in Utah.
