            D. T. Corbin, Esq. U. S. Attorney,
            Yorkville, S. C.
            Sir:
            I transmit the copy of a letter just received from Major W. H. Brown, commanding post at Chester, S. C. I shall refer him to you.
            It seems to me advisable to have arrests made in Chester—at least of the most guilty parties.
            Please confer immediately with Major Brown, and
            affairs in S. C.
            
            
            
           advise him according to your best judgment.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
