            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the power of attorney from Mrs. Mary E. Cromwell, administratrix of the estate of C. B. Cluskey, deceased, to Mr. Edward Simms, which accompanied your letter of the 14th ult., relating to the completion of a contract with the said Cluskey for the erection of a Light House on St. Simon's Island, Georgia.
            I am of the opinion that the power of Attorney mentioned is valid and effectual for the purpose for which it is designed, viz: to authorize Mr. Simms to complete the contract aforesaid, and to receive from the Government payments of such amounts as are or may become due thereunder, as agent of the administratrix of Cluskey's estate.
            Very resp'lly,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            certain power of attorney valid
