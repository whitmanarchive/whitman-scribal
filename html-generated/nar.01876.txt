            J. J. Pope, Esq.
            Savannah, Georgia.
            Sir:
            I have received your letters of the 29th ultimo, asking for compensation for services alleged to have been rendered for the Government in the criminal prosecutions, in the Southern District of Georgia, against Foster Blodgett and Charles H. Hopkins.
            Before the claim can be considered it is necessary that I should have positive information that you
                acc't of J. J. Pope, Geo. 
            
                
            were retained under the authority of the Government. You state that Mr. Fitch, District Attorney, informs you that he had received authority from Washington to retain you. You do not state from what Department such alleged authority issued. I will thank you to ascertain what Department it was, and the date of the authority, so that an investigation may be made into the recorded correspondence of that Department.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
