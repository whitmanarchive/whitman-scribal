            It appears from papers on file in this office that on the 13th of November, 1858, at Harrisburgh, Pennsylvania, one, Joseph S. Carmany enlisted in the military service of the United States. We have no information at hand of the regiment or corps to which he was assigned. Carmany himself is now in Dayton, Nevada Territory. It is also appearsalso appears that on the 16th of May, 1859, he deserted, and remained for several years in parts unknown to his friends. He now applies to the President to be pardoned for the offence of desertion.
            Before determining in this office what recommendation to make to
            
            Cancelled.
