            Hon. J. A. J. Creswell,
            Postmaster General,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Mr. Roger M. Sherman, of this Department, is about to go South to make investigations of supposed frauds upon the Government in the States of North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee.
            He will frequently require local information as to residence and character of persons, and other similar points. The Postmasters in the respective neighborhoods will probably be able to furnish him with such information—and would, no doubt, readily do so under direction from you.
            I therefore, request that you will do me the favor to furnish me with a general letter, (which Mr. Sherman may carry with him,) directing the Postmasters in those States to render him any assistance in their power.
            
            Sherman's investigation
            
            
            
            For obvious reasons I suggest that your letter be so phrased as not to indicate to postmasters the particular object of Mr. Sherman's investigations.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
