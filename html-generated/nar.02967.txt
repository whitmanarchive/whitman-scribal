            Hon. T. W. Osborn.
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to say that the papers filed in support of the application of Sherman Conant for the office of Marshal of the United States for the Northern District of Florida, are somewhat voluminous, and that your letter was received too late on yesterday to enable him to have the papers copied by eleven o'clock this morning, as requested.
                
            sending abstract of certain papers
                
            
                
             As the enclosed synopsis of said papers was prepared in the expectation of your calling this morning, the Attorney General has thought that it would answer the purposes for which the papers were wanted—and has accordingly directed me to send it.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. J. Falls.
            Chief Clerk.
