            U. S. Attorney,
            Columbia, S. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 19th enclosing the list of persons arrested, and placed in custody at Yorkville, has been received.
            I thank you for your promptness in forwarding this.
            I suppose that these are the only persons arrested in South Carolina
            arrests S. C.
            
            
            
            by the military without warrant? Am I right?
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
