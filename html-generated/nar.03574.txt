            Hon. George S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            Referring to your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a communication from the special Treasury Agent Ira Ayer, Jr., recommending a nolle prosequi of an indictment against Patrick McDonough in the District Court of the United States at Norfolk, Va. I have the honor to
            
            Pat McDonough
            Va
            
            
            
            say that the recommendation of Mr. Ayer has been the subject of a correspondence between this Department, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia—that the District Attorney thinks there are good reasons why the indictment should not be thus disposed of—and that in his judgment I concur.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
