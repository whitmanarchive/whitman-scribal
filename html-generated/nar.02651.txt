            Sebastian Brown, Esq.
            No. 51½ St. Paul st.
            Baltimore, Md.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 5th instant, I have to say that I am daily at my office and receive visitors between the hours of 10 and 11 A. M. Yet such is the pressure on my time from the multitude of visitors at this season, and other causes, that I cannot with certainty name a day and hour when I can have the pleasure of seeing you.
            It is likely that I shall be absent from Washington Thursday and Friday of this week, but on any other day, unless unavoidably engaged, I shall be happy to see you at that hour.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            visiting hours
