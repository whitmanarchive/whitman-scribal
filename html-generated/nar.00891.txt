            Hon. John A. Rawlins,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I send enclosed herewith a copy of a letter received form E. W. Andrews, dated April 1st ult., and relating to an action of ejectment brought in the Circuit Court of Jefferson county, West Virginia, to recover about twenty-one acres of land, situated on the Potomac river, and hitherto supposed to belong to the United States.
            In this letter of Mr. Andrews it is stated that Mr. Smith, U. S. Attorney for West Virginia, employed Mr. Andrews, with the sanction of Mr. Stanbery, then Attorney General. I do not find from the records of this office that Mr. Andrews was employed by the Attorney General, and
                
                Harper's Ferry ejectment suit
                see Index Letter Book H. p. 32
            
            
            
            I am led to suppose that the War Department has, directly, authorized his employment.
            I am anxious only that the proper direction be given in the case, and, if the War Department has control of it, I desire that the Department will communicate directly with Mr. Andrews and Mr. Smith, and so inform this office. If, hitherto, the control of the case has been with this office, I will, on receiving from you an expression of your opinion as to what direction should be given, reply to the letter of Mr. Andrews.
            I have the honor to be,
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
