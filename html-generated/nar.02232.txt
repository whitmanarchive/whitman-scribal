            District of Columbia.
            The cause of action being
            for acts done by Mr. Delano as an
            officer of the Government, to wit
            Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
            and in the line of his duty, you will
            appear for his defence.
            You can probably learn

            of the Interior, all facts
            necessary for the defence.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
