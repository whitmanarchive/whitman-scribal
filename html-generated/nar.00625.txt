            F. W. Power, Esq.
            Richmond, Va.
            Sir:
            In reply to your letter of the 11th instant, I am directed by the Attorney General to say that the case of the National Cemetery near Yorktown is now under examination in this office. The Attorney General has no
            
            
            duty to perform in reference to the price of the land, but confines himself to the investigation of the validity of the title proposed to be conveyed.
            Very respectfully,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
