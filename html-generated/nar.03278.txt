            Hon. C. Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I herewith transmit a copy of a letter from R. McP. Smith, Esq., U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, in reference to a pension claim of A. E. Garrett, supposed to be fraudulent; and I have the honor to request that the certified copy of Garrett's affidavit which the District Attorney requests, may be furnished to him.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            copy requested.
