            To James M. Carlisle, Esq.
            John A. Wills, Esq. &amp;
            Hon. M. Carpenter.
            Gentlemen:
            I have received your letter of the 22d inst. relative to certain cases lately decided by the Court of Claims, in which you are counsel. If you desire a postponement of the issuing of mandates in those cases upon grounds of personal convenience, I shall not object to complying with your request; but if it is proposed by you to make any new case for the consideration of the Court, I do
            
            
            
            not see, as at present advised, that my duty will permit the action which you request.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
