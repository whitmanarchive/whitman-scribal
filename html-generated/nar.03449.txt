            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2d inst. enclosing the copy of a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States for mandamus against you, upon the application of the State of Kentucky, and requesting that I would appear in your behalf in said proceeding—and to say in reply that I will appear in your behalf, and resist the granting of the order.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            will appear for Sec. of Treas.
