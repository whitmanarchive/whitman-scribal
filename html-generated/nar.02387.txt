            W. J. Bawden, Esq.
            Fort Scott, Kansas.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 21st instant, I have to say that it is not the usage of this office to give opinions on legal questions except at the call of the President or of a Head of Department.
           I enclose to you a copy of the Act in relation to artificial limbs. You will perceive that the second section makes the communication money payable in the same manner that pensions are paid.
            On the subject of exemption of pension money from attachment for execution, I would refer
              p. 668   
              concerning pension-money 
            
            you to the second section of the Act of July 7, 1838, (1 Brightley's Digest, 744,) and the third section of the Act of June 6, 1866, (2 Brightley's Digest, 490.)
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
