      H. Price, Esq.
      Davenport, Iowa.
      Sir:
      I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt, through the reference of
        the Secretary of the Interior, of your letter addressed to him under date of the 13th
        instant, asking that, if not certain letter,
          Iowa.
         contrary to the regulations of
        the Department, to be furnished with the figures showing the gross receipts of the Clerk of
        the Circuit Court of the United States in the States of Missouri and Kansas.
      In reply, I have to inform you that it is not the custom of the Department to furnish such
        information to any one, except some satisfactory reason is given for requiring the
        information.
      No such reason being given in your letter, the Attorney General declines to accede to your
        request.
      Very respectfully,
      A. J. Falls,
      Chief Clerk.
