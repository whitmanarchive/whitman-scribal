            J. R. McBride, Esq.
            Boise City, Idaho
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 10th instant requesting a direction to the District Attorney of Idaho to continue until the next April term the suit against
            declining request to continue &amp;c.
            
            
            
            the sureties of H. W. Maulton, the defaulting Marshal, has been received.
            I do not feel at liberty to give the direction which you desire. Since the expiration of the time allowed to Mr. Maulton for a settlement, the 1st of Oct. there has been ample time for service of any process against him, unless he has absconded, which I do not understand to be the case. I do not see therefore that there is any reason for present indulgence to the sureties, on account of that indulgence to their principal.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
