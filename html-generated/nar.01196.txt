            Reason Roberts, Esq.
            Sweetwater, Tenn.
            Sir:
            The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., asking his official opinion upon your claim for bounty, and to say that the statute establishing this office does not permit him to answer questions of law except when propounded by the President or the Head of one of the Executive Departments. He is obliged therefore to decline your request. The papers are respectfully returned.
            Very respectfully,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
            (papers enc.)
            Opinion declined
