            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit a letter from the U. S. Attorney for the Territory of New Mexico, of the 3d inst. together with the papers mentioned therein, the subject of which appears to relate more immediately to the suspension or disallowance of certain fee accounts rendered to your Department by the Commissioners appointed by the court of that Territory—It is thought proper to refer these papers to you for the information of your Department—but I request that, when they are no longer needed there, you will cause them to be returned to this office.
            Very Respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c
            E. R. Hoar, Attorney Gen'l.
            
            Fee acc'ts Terr. New Mex.
