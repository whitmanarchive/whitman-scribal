            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir: On the 18th day of July last, the
            
            
            
            Chief Clerk of the War Department, in your absence, transmitted to me certain papers relative to fraudulent transactions on the part of Capt. William G. Hodges Quartermaster's Department, and his clerk, David V. Whiting, and requested that the proper law officer be directed to institute proceedings looking to the prosecution of said Whiting for compliicity with Hodges in the fraud.
            Accordingly, I directed the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas to prosecute Whiting. The U.S. Attorney has written to this Department inquiring whether he shall proceed against Whiting in a criminal prosecution alone, or in a civil suit, to recover back the money embezzled, or both. My original direction, following the request in the letter received from your Department was confined to a criminal proceeding.
            Since receiving his letter, I have directed him to inquire what would probably be the result of a civil suit, looking to the solvency, &amp;c. of Whiting, and am awaiting his answer.
            As the War Department is doubtless well informed upon the subject, I would thank you for any suggestions as to the advisableness of a civil suit against WhitingWhiting.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
