            Hon. Horace Maynard, M. C.
            Washington, D. C.
            Dear Sir:
            Your letter of Tuesday, enclosing the copy of one from the Marshal of Georgia, has been received.
            As far as I am advised, the view of the District Attorney as to the existing law, is right; but the facts reported by the Marshal show an urgent necessity for a change in the law.
            Permit me to call your attention to some observations on the subject of U.S. Prisons on the 3d page of my annual report presented last winter, a copy of which I enclose. If those recommendations should not be adopted by Congress, I suggest at least, a law should be passed making it highly penal for the keepers of jails in States which allow the use of their prisons to the United States, to suffer prisoners to go at large.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            certain case
            U.S. prisoners, &amp;c.
