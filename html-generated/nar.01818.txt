            Sir: I have received your letter of the 10th instant.
            I do not see that the matters which you state authorize any official action on my part. If any law of the United States has been broken by any of the parties to whom you refer, you should apply to the District Attorney of the U. S. for your District, who will no doubt institute prosecutions in those cases where criminal laws have been violated, and proceedings by quo warranto where office is held in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
            The commissionership is in the appointment of the Circuit Court, and I have no power over it.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            action declined
