            D. T. Corbin, Esq.
            U.S. Attorney,
            Yorkville, S. C.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 3d inst. enclosing an account of the proceedings of the Town Council of Union, on the 25th of October last, and a copy of your letter of Nov. 3d, to the Town Council.
            Your letter to the Town Council is fully approved by this Department.
            The unfortunate doings at Union show the necessity of caution in all special measures to suppress crime in South Carolina. Hence I think that no extensive operations as that in Union, should be undertaken without a previous understanding between yourself, the Marshal, and the military commander of the post.
            The Deputy Marshal and all others concerned in making arrests, should understand that they will be
            Ku Klux in S. C.
            
            
                
                sustained in no unnecessary harshness, and that they are expected to perform their duties in a decent and gentlemanly manner. 
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
