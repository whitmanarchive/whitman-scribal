            Charles Abel, Esq.
            Collector Internal Revenue, 1st Dist. Penn.
            Philadelphia.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 29th inst. inquiring whom you are to recognize as U. S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania is received.
            It is not the duty of this office to instruct officers of the Internal Revenue, but I may state, what no doubt you already know, that the President has appointed and commissioned John P. O'Neill, Esq. to be District Attorney for that District—and that he has taken the official oath. These are the only facts which it is deemed necessary to mention.
            Very respectfully yours,
            J. Hubley Ashton, Act'g Attorney General
