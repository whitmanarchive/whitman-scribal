            Leander Holmes, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney.
            Vancouver, Washington Terr.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 28th ult. is received.
            If it should appear that the only real objection to you is that you prosecute offenders without regard to their political relations, I shall certainly not favor your removal. Political friends have no greater right to break the law than political foes.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
           
           
            answer to charges 
            see p. 94 ante
