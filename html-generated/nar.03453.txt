            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ult. enclosing a copy of a letter form the Hon. Noah Davis, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York to the Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue, setting forth the difficulties in the way of a speedy and satisfactory disposition of Internal Revenue cases in that District.
            I am fully impressed with the necessity of an increase of the Judicial force of the United States in that District, and will urge the matter upon the attention of members of Congress.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            concerning Revenue cases in New York.
