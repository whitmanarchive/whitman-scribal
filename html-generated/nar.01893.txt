           Hon. James M. Harvey,
           Governor of Kansas,
           Topeka.
           Dear Sir:
           I wrote to Judge Horton yesterday in relation to Mr. Williams. If he will show you my letter, which it will be entirely agreeable to me to permit, you will probably desire no other answer to your letter of the 27th ult., which reached me this morning.
           Very Respectfully,
           E. R. Hoar.
