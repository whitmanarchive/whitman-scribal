            Oct. 13, 1871.
            Hon. R. B. Mason,
            Mayor, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            Chicago, Illinois.
            Sir:
            As Disbursing Agent for the United States Jail in this City, I have been requested by the officers of that institution to withhold from their compensation one day's pay, to be transmitted to you in aid of the sufferers by the late disastrous conflagration in your city. I accordingly with great pleasure comply with their request, and have the honor to enclose herewith a draft on New York for the sum of $63.59, to be used by you as in your own judgment may seem best for the purposes for which the amount is donated.
            Will you be pleased to acknowledge the receipt of the draft, that I may inform these gentlemen that it has reached its destination?
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
            470
            $63.59 to Chicago
