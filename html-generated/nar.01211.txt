            Hon. Thos. J. Durant,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date, and to say in reply that he sees no reason for furnishing to Mr. Stancel a copy of the letter referred to. It is an official communication from the U. S. District Attorney to this office and, as such, confidential. There is nothing in it, however, to prevent its being shown to you, if you desire to see it, and will call at this office
            
                case of Mr. Stancel
              see pp. 35 186 ante p. 534 Ins Book A.
            
            
            for that purpose.
            Very respectfully your ob't serv't,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
