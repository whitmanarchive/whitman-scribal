            Mr. Wm. Ellis.
            Houston, Miss.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 28th instant.
            It is not customary for the Attorney General to give opinions on legal questions at the call of private citizens. But I will depart from the rule so far as to say to you that the holding of an office, and the taking of an oath prior to the rebellion, does not disqualify a man for office now, unless after having taken such an oath he engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States or gave aid and comfort to the enemies thereof.
            Whether your acts amounted to such insurrection, rebellion, aid or comfort, I cannot undertake to decide.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
