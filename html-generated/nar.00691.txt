          C. L. Dickerman, Esq.
           81 Washington street,
           Boston, Mass.
           Sir:
            In reply to your letter of the 17th instant, touching the ownership of certain land near the city of New London, Connecticut, proposed to be conveyed to the United States for naval purposes, I have to inform you that, the title to this property having been passed upon by my predecessor, and all the papers relating thereto returned by him to the Navy Department, on the 26th of June last, I am unable to furnish the information requested.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Assistant Attorney General.
