            Hon. George S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, through your reference, of a letter addressed to you under date of the 3d instant, by the Secretary of War, relative to certain frauds practised in the payment of Capt. Bryson's Company of Independent Tennessee Scouts.
            To enable this Department to investigate these alleged frauds it will be necessary to have the original muster-roll and affidavits upon which such payments were made. I will thank you to cause these papers to be transmitted to me at the earliest opportunity. When they shall have been received the proper steps will be taken by this Department for the prosecution of the guilty parties.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
