            Messrs. Hughes, Denver, &amp; Peck,
            Attorneys at Law,
            Washington, D. C.
            Gentlemen:
            I have caused an investigation to be made of the case of W. W. Burns, vs. The United States, now before the Supreme Court, in reference to your proposition of the 23d ultimo for a compromise.
            The judgment in the Court of Claims was about One hundred and one thousand dollars. According to my information the compromise proposed by you would reduce that judgment to a little below Ninety eight thousand dollars.
            I understand that there is a legal question of some importance in the case. In view, then, of the importance of this question, and of the very slight reduction of the judgment, which you propose, I do not feel at liberty to accept your proposition.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            Case of W. W. Burns vs. The U. S.
