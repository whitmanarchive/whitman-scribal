            D. H. Starbuck, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Salem, N. C.
            Sir:
            I enclose a copy of a letter of Hon. Wm. W. Holden, from Mr. W. F. Henderson, and suggest that you make inquiry—and, if the proof can be obtained, that you promptly prosecute the parties named.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            case in N. C.
