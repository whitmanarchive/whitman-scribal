            August 14, 1865.
            To the
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I had the honor to inform you on the 10th inst. that I had written to Daniel S. Dickinson, Esq. Attorney for the southern District of New York, for information concerning the seizure of the barque "Dahomey." I have this morning received Mr. Dickinson's reply, a copy of which is herewith inclosed.
            Mr. Dickinson, being in possession of the facts upon which the seizure was made, is of opinion that the suit should be prosecuted.
            I am sir,
            Most respectfully yours, &amp;c.
            James Speed
            Attorney General.
