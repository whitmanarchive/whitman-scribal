            Major W. S. Brown, U. S. A.
            Chester, S. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 14th inst. has been received.
            I communicated its contents to the District Attorney, Mr. Corbin, who is understood to be now at Yorkville, and have requested him to confer with you upon the subject at once.
            My judgment concurs with yours as to the expediency of prompt arrests, but Mr. Corbin being on the spot can advice upon fuller information.
           Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Ku Klux &amp;c. in S. C.
