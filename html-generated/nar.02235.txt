            David H. Mason, Esq.
            U.S. Attorney,
            Boston, Mass.
            Sir:
            If you are satisfied that the physical or mental condition of David E. Saunders, Jr. is such that he should not be tried upon the indictment now pending against him in your district, you are authorized to consent that the indictment shall be placed on file, and the case withdrawn from the docket, and the defendant released from custody upon his own recognizance; or, if, under the circumstances, you deem that insufficient, a recognizance with satisfactory surety to appear and submit himself to the court, upon notice to the District Attorney.
            I enclose the physicians certificate as you
            
            case of D. E. Saunders, Jr. Mass.
                
                request.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
