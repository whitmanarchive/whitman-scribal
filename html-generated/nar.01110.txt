           Harvey Myers, Esq.
           326 Scott street,
           Covington, Ky.
           Sir:
           I have received your letter of the 8th inst., relating to the case of Gedge &amp; Gabaugh, vs. The United States. I have examined what purports to be the transcript of the record, now in the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and I find that it does not contain the original writ of error, but what purports to be a copy; and it does not appear that the citation was served. The Attorney General cannot waive the want of service of the citation.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            Case of Gedge &amp; Gabaugh
