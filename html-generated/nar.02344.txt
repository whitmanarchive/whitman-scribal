            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return
            herewith the papers received with your
            letter of the 22d ult., relating to the title
            to a tract of land situated on Chambers
            Island, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, (part
            of fractional Sec. 32, in Township 32, N.,
            Range 26, E.,) desired for a Light House site,—and to state, that, upon examination of these papers, I am of opinion that the proposed 
            conveyance of Lewis S. Williams, and wife,
            would vest in the United States a good
            &amp; valid title to the premises referred to.
            I am, Sir,
            Very respectfully,
            John M. Binckley,
            Acting Attorney Gen'l.
