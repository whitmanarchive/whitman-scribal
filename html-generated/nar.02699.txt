            Sebastian Brown, Esq.
            No. 51½ St. Paul street,
            Baltimore, Md.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 23d, I have to say that I do not feel at liberty to recommend the pardon of J. D. Martin. I understand that
            J. D. Martin pardon case
            
            
            
             he has been released upon his own recognizance, or in some other easy way, by the U.S. Court in Massachusetts, with the understanding that he shall appear for trial only in the event of the restoration of his physical and mental health.
            It seems to me that this is all the relief which his friends can reasonably ask.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
