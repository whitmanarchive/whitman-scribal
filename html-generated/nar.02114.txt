            S. M. Ashenfelter, Esq. U. S. Attorney,
            Santa Fé, New Mexico.
            Sir: I have received your letter of the 9th ultimo, suggesting that it be made penal by Congress to purchase cattle from persons unlawfully trading with the Indians.
            Your suggestions seem to be wise, and I have transmitted your letter to the Department of the Interior, which has Indian affairs especially in charge, calling the attention of the Head of the Department to the subject.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                        
            Indian question
