      Hon. Noah H. Swayne,
      Cincinnati, Ohio.
      Sir:
      I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Albert Evans, Assistant
        Special Agent at Brownsville, Texas, to the Commissioner of Customs, and referred by that
        officer to the Attorney General, relative to the removal of U.S. Commissioner Parker, and
        the appointment in his stead of a person as Commissioner who has the interest of the
        government at heart. I have asked Mr. Sargeant to ascertain the name of some proper person
        at Brownsville, to be recommended to you for appointment as Commissioner—but Mr.
        Sargeant has not as yet given the information to this office. I therefore send this letter
        to you, with the belief that you may yourself know of some one who could be entrusted with
        the office, if you conclude that there are proper reasons for the removal of Mr. Parker
      Very Resp. Yours,
      J. Hubley Ashton,
      Ass't. Attorney Gen'l.
