Hon. Joseph Carey,
Washington, D. C.
Sir:
The Attorney General is now absent from Washington, but I find upon his table your letter of the 11th inst. enclosing a draft of a bill for the reorganization of the Court of Claims, upon which the Attorney General has made an endorsement to the effect that he has examined this draft, but does not wish to recommend any action. As he is absent, and as you may wish the draft before he returns, I have accordingly sent to you enclosed herewith.
Very respectfully,
your obd't serv't,
W. A. Field,
Act'g Attorney General.
