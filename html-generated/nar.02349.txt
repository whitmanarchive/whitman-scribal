            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the papers transmitted by you to this Office on the 15th of June last, for the consideration of the Attorney General, touching the Title to a piece of land situated in the Houghton County, Michigan, being parts of Lots 8 and 9, in Section 13, Township 53 N., Range 33 W., and containing in all about 1.44/100 acres, which property is desired for Range Light purposes, at Portage Entry, in that State. From an examination of these papers, I am of Opinion that the proposed
            
            
            
            conveyance from Earl Edgerton and his wife will vest in the United States a good and valid Title to the premises.
            I am, Sir,
            Very Respectfully,
            John M. Binckley,
            Acting Attorney General.
