           Hon. J. D. Cox,
           Secretary of the Interior.
           Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit enclosed herewith a letter from the U. S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan, with the accompanying papers, all relating to a suit in equity, in which Addison P. Brewer is complainant, and James H. Kidd &amp; Osmond S. Tower are respondents. Will you please give such instructions to the U. S. Attorney in regard to this suit as seem to you desirable, or inform this office of the instructions you wish given him, and they will immediately be given.
            As there is no fund belonging to this office out of which he can be paid, he must, if employed, be paid by your Department.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
            Case of Brewer vs Kidd &amp; Tower, Michigan
