            Hon. Schuyler Colfax.
            Vice President of the United States.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to inform you that the papers to which you referred this morning have just come from the Executive Mansion.

            
                
            The Chief Justice of Montana desires that his resignation may take effect at the conclusion of the next term of the Second District Court, which, he says, will probably be by the first Monday in April, or as soon thereafter as his successor shall be appointed and qualified.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls, Chief Clerk.
                
            resignation of Ch. Justice Montana.
