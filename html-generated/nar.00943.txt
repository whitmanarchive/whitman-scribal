            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th inst. with its enclosure relative to the alleged intention of the people of Coeyman's to sue out an injunction against the further prosecution of the Hudson River Improvement, and requesting that the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York be instructed to assume charge of the interests of the United States in any proceedings which may be instituted.
            I have issued the desired instructions to that officer.
            Very Respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
