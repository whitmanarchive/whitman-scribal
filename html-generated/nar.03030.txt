            Hon. Peter M. Dox,
            House of Representatives,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your reference of the 8th instant, of an account against the United States of Messrs. Ellis &amp; Caldwell, attorneys at law, Jacksonville, Ala., has been considered.
            It appears that Mr. Caldwell, of that firm, rendered assistance in a criminal prosecution against a person charged with violating the postage laws of the United States.—This service was apparently rendered at the instance of Mr. Southworth, a special agent of the Post Office Department. As it was not rendered at the request of this Department, I do not feel authorized, under existing laws, to pay for it out of any funds under my control. This I regret, for the service seems to have been useful, and to have been well worth the compensation charged.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            acc't of Ellis &amp; Caldwell, Ala.
