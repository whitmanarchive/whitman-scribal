            B. F. Fifield, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Montpelier, Vermont.
            Sir:
            Application has been made at this Department for the release of the bail of Frank B Spalding, late a clerk in the post office at Rutland
            F. B. Spalding's bail Vt.
            
            
            
            Vermont. The papers presented do not state the facts very clearly, but I infer from them that Spalding was held to bail for some offence against againstagainst the post office laws, and has escaped.
            Will you inform me what are the facts—what steps have been taken to enforce the recognizance—how the matter stands in court—and whether there is any good reason for the extraordinary favor asked by these applicants.
            The reasons alleged are mainly these—that Spalding was supposed to be an upright youth until his offence, and that it will be a hardship for his bail to pay the forfeiture—neither of which reasons presents itself to me as having any force.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
