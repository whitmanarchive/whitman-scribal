            Hon. Wm W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            This will be taken to the War Department by Alexander Johnston, Esq. who is employed by that branch of the Department having in charge the business of the Court of Claims. He deems it important in the defence of a suit there that he should inspect an original book in the War Department, as he will explain to you.
            If consistent with your regulations, I will be obliged to you if you will allow him to make the inspection.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            request to War. Dept.
