            Hon. J. T. Wilson,
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th inst. relative to the papers placed on file in this Department on the subject of an application by Gen. M. H. Enochs for the position of U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Ohio. In reply I have the honor to state that these papers were withdrawn by a gentleman who represented himself as acting under instructions from Gen. Enochs.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.

            certain papers withdrawn
