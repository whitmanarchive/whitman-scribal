            Charles B. Collier, Esq.
            Dear Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 19th, I have to say that in cases similar to that of Mr. Lawrence, the proper mode to obtain relief is by special act of Congress. Such has been the course taken heretofore in cases precisely like that of Mr. Lawrence, and I do not see that I can make any other suggestion than that he should follow the accustomed mode of obtaining relief.
            Very respectfully yours,
            Henry Stanbery.
