            Henry J. Adams, Esq.
            Leavenworth, Kansas.
            Sir:
            We have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you inquire, substantially, whether the United States Courts have jurisdiction in a class of suits indicated by you,—and ask that an opinion be given, and communicated to the District Attorney for his instruction. I have to say, in reply, that jurisdiction is a question for the Courts; the Attorney General's opinions are given, by law, only to the President and heads of Departments; and instructions to District Attorneys in particular cases are given only when such cases have arisen and are officially before us.
            Respectfully, &amp;c.
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
