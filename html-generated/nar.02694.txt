            Messrs. Binst &amp; Binst,
            Charleston, S. C.
            Sir:
            On the 15th I addressed you a hasty note, in answer to yours of the 11th.
            At that time I was too much engaged to give a careful attention to the subject, and perhaps did not understand the drift of your letter. Upon looking further into the matter, I am disposed to think that you had reference to treaties between this Government and Prussia.
            Though precluded by the rules of the office from giving Opinions on legal questions to private parties, I will refer you to the Opinion of Attorney General Cushing on the subject of Droit d'Aubaine, which you will find in vol. VIII of the Opinions of Attorneys General, p. 410.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            referred to former Opinion
            see p. 191 ante
