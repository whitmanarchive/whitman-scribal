            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to send enclosed herewith a copy of a letter received today from Messrs. Sands &amp; Wilson, Attorneys of one Daniel Dusky. They ask that a copy of a pardon alleged to have been granted to Dusky, and to have been lost, may be transmitted to them. This letter is sent to the Department of State, for such action as may seem best to that Department.
            Very Respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
            Dan'l Dusky's pardon—copy of -
