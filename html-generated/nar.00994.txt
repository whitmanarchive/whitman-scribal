            September 22, 1869.
            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I would advise that all the suits pending in the Courts of England between the United States, and persons who claim property under the title of the late Confederate States, (so called,) be discontinued, upon the best terms that can be made, except such as can be supported by the agreement between Frazer, Trenholm and others, with the agents of the United States, of the date of Sept. 25, 1867; and those only so far as is necessary to assert and enforce that agreement. I can see no probable advantage to our government or country in any other or farther prosecution of those suits.
            Very Respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Suits in English Courts bet. U. S. vs. Claimants under Confederate States.
