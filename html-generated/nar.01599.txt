            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 29th ultimo, transmitting certain papers from the Quartermaster General, relative to Wagon-Master W. D. Kirk, who is alleged to have appropriated to his own use, in the Territory of Mexico, a certain wagon-train, and a large quantity of military stores,—and have forwarded the same to the U. S. Attorney for the Western Dist. of Texas, with instructions to institute such proceedings as may be necessary to secure the United States, and to punish the offender.
            Very resp'lly,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; acting Attorney General.
            fraud of Wagon-Master Kirk, in Texas
