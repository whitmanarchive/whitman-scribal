            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a letter from Assistant Attorney General Talbot, enclosing the account of Wm. H. Bent for services as an expert in the case of Matthew Baird, vs. The United States. These services were rendered under the sanction of the War Department, given in a letter
                trans. bill of W. H. Bent. 
            
            from the Secretary dated September 27, 1869. The amount seems reasonable, and I have approved the bill.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
