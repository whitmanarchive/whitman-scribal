           The Honorable The Secretary of The Navy.
            Sir:
            Respectfully referring to your letter of the 15th of July last, relating to a decree made in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois, whereby it was ordered that certain money be paid to W. S. Taylor as Attorney, I have to say that in reply to a letter sent by me to the District Attorney of that District, I have received a letter, a copy
                certain Decree of U. S. Court Illinois 
            
            of which is enclosed. It appears that the decree was vacated August 26th last.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
