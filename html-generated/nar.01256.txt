            J. E. Townsend, Esq.
            Clerk U. S. District Court,
            Jacksonville, Fla.
            Sir:
            On the 14th of May, 1869, by direction of the Attorney General, I transmitted to "Franklin Fraser, Esq. Clerk U. S. District Court, Fernandina, Fla.," the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of The United States vs. Jasper Strong, et al. with request to file it in the Court. Its receipt has never been acknowledged, and the Attorney General requests that you
                Concerning Sup. Ct. Mandate sent. 
            
            will inform him if this mandate has been received and filed in your Court. An early reply is requested.
            Very respectfully yours,
            M. F. Pleasants, Chief Clerk.
