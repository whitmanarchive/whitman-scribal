      Hon. T. A. Sawyer
      U.S. Senate.
      Sir:
      I have received yours of the 9th instant, and also the enclosure from Mr. Martin, Auditor
        of the Treasury for the Post Office Department, in reference to the Postal account of Mr.
        Hubbell, late Postmaster at Orangeburg, S.C.
      Mr. Hubbell desires that time may be given for application to Congress for relief in his
        case.
      I am not advised of the grounds upon which he seeks such relief, and will be obliged to
        you if you will cause them to be made known to me.
      Accts of Postmaster Hubbell S.C.
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
