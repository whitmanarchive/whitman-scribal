            Sir:
            Referring to your letter of March 13, enclosing a communication from the Chief of Engineers, in relation to the U.S. Military land at Point Peter, Georgia, I have the honor to enclose the certified copy of a deed from Benjamin Wall, U.S. Marshal, of Georgia, to Samuel Howard, and of a plot annexed to the same, furnished by the Dist. Attorney of Georgia, in pursuance of instructions from this Department. I also enclose the copy of a letter dated May 11th, from Mr. Pope, the District Attorney.
            Through some inadvertence these papers were not transmitted to you before.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.

            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
