            Nov. 23, 1871.
            Hon. Edwards Pierrepont,
            No. 16 Wall street,
            New York.
            Sir:
            Your letters, that of the 19th, to the Solicitor General, and that of the 20th, to myself, in reference to the matter of Polhamius and Jackson, have been received.
            I hope I was not understood in my previous letter any suspicion that your conduct had not been dictated by high professional and public principles. I surely would not knowingly direct a groundless prosecution against any person, reputable or disreputable. In this case, however, the War Department is satisfied that there is at least enough of a case to require a formal legal investigation. Should the investigation fail to show a ground for prosecution parties will of course escape molestation. If a ground for prosecution should be shown,
            Polhaimus &amp; Jackson, N. Y.
            
            
            
            there is no occasion why it should not be pressed.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
