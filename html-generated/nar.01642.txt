            Hon. J. A.J. Creswell,
            Postmaster General.
            Sir:
            The letter of the Dist. Attorney of Nevada, of the 6th instant, which is referred to me from your office, reports that an important prosecution against David Baker and others, for robbing the mail, is pending in the District Court of Nevada,— and he desires authority to send a person, at the expense of The United States, to the scene of the robbery, for the purpose of preparing the case.
            There is no fund under the control of this Department, out of which such expenses can be paid. I think it desirable that the District Attorney should receive the aid he requests, in view of the special necessity of an energetic and well-prepared prosecution of such offences in that part of the country, and under the law this Department has no means for furnishing it to him.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman, Attorney General.
            case of David Baker Nevada, mail robbing. 
            employing special Assist. are declined
