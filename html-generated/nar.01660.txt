            James Atkyns, Esq.
            Atlanta, Georgia.
            Sir:
            On the 19th of November last, I wrote an official letter to W. G. Irwin, Esq. of Atlanta, and forwarded the same by mail. It has come back to me from the dead-letter office.—There may have been some mistake in the direction. Will you read my letter which I enclose to you, and if you can identify the individual to whom it should go, will you be kind enough to send it to him. Otherwise, please return it to me.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            certain miscarried letter.
