            Hon. George H. Wright,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 27th ult. suggesting an increase of the compensation of the Hon. Ralph P. Lowe, Assistant District Attorney of Iowa.
            I have carefully considered all that you say in relation to the value of Judge Lowe's services, and deem it fortunate that the Government has been able to secure the services of so able a man. But I could not raise his compensation without setting a precedent that would be inconvenient, and perhaps unjust. There is no District with business no greater than that of Iowa in which the Assistant
            increased compensation declined
            
            
            
            is paid a larger sum than the present compensation of Judge Lowe; and if his should be increased I should be obliged to increase that of similar officers in other Districts, or subject this Department to the charge of partiality.
            And I do not feel at liberty to order compensation for his services prior to his appointment. I have no doubt that, in his case, the services were rendered in good faith, and were beneficial to the Government. But it is my rule to direct compensation for no unauthorized services. Manifest and serious abuses would grow out of a different rule.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
