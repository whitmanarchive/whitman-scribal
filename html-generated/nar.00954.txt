            Hon. C. Delano,
            Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            I have just received the inclosed telegram from an officer in your Department.
            I am not aware that it is a matter with which I have any official connection; and the sending a dispatch to this office without authority, at a charge of $12:29, is not a practice which I wish established.
            Very Respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar, Attorney General
            
            unauthorized telegrams.
