            Mrs. N. F. Kennedy,
            Louisville, Ky.
            Madam:
            I have received your letter of the 3d instant.
            I learn that in some cases persons abroad, circumstances as those for whom you desire the aid of the Government, in transportation home, are sometimes brought home in naval vessels.
            The matter is more especially under the direction of the Secretary of State. Upon a conference with him I learn that he has been addressed on the subject of the persons to whom your letter relates; and I suppose that either you or Dr. Dobbin will learn from him what can be done for them.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            case of certain persons abroad.
