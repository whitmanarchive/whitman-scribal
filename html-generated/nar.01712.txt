            Thos. H. Talbot, Esq.
            Assistant Attorney General,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Will you report to me what legal questions are involved in the case of The United States, appellants, vs. William W. Hubbell, appealed to the Supreme Court from the Court of Claims, and also give me your opinion upon the propriety of dismissing the appeal taken by the United States.
            Representations have been made to me that it is unjust to Mr. Hubbell to prosecute this appeal, and I desire to have your report on the subject, in order to determine whether such representations are well founded.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            case of U. S. vs. Hubbell.
