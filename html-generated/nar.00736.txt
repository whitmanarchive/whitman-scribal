            Hon. Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            The Union Pacific RR. Co. have, by their President, assented to the arrangement in protection of the public interests which the President has required from the Company.
            Some little time will be needed to complete this arrangement with the necessary formality—and in the interval I am satisfied to advise the acceptance of the above engagement as sufficient to authorize the advance of the subsidy in the two sections of the road now ready for acceptance.
            I have the honor to be, yours, &amp;c.
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General
            See p. 331 seq
