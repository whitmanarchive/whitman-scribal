            Messrs. R. &amp; J. Semmes,
            Attorneys at Law,
            Mobile, Ala.
            Gentlemen:
            Your letter of the 9th inst. has been referred to the Secretary of the Treasury, in whose files all the papers are kept relating to the real estate of the United States, occupied for Custom House purposes,—and among them, doubtless, the Act of the State Legislature ceding jurisdiction in the case you mention.—An affidavit should be presented at the Treasury Department from the party interested, setting forth the character of his interest, and praying a certified copy of the document.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            J. M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
