           Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 21st inst., enclosing a bill of Patrick Short, the person employed by the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York as a detective in the recent Fenian movements on the frontier. I sent this bill to the U. S. Attorney, with a request for a more detailed statement of the kind and amount of service rendered by Mr. Short; and have received to day a letter from him of which I enclose a copy.
            From the statements contained in this letter it seems to me the bill of Mr. Short is reasonable in amount,
            
            Bill of Patrick Short detective
              see Ins. Book A, p. 568. 
            
            
                
                and I am unable to see how the United States Attorney could have efficiently performed what was required of him without the employment of some such person as a detective. The bill of Mr. Short is returned.
            I have the honor to be,
            very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
