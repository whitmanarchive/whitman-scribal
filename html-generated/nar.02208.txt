          Will you be good enough to send me, at your earliest convenience, the opinion and the briefs in the case of the barque "John Griffin," appealed from the Circuit Court of your District? The case will be reached very early in the term.
          I remain, your obd't serv't,
          Clement Hugh Hill,
            Assistant Attorney General.
