           February 3, 1871.
            Hon. Stephen L. Mayham,
            Sub. Com. Private Land Claims
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and to inform you that upon an examination of the files of this Department, it does not appear that any general order has been issued relative to the decisions of the Dist. Court of the United States for the Dist. of California, in Mexican Land Grant Cases.
            The following is an extract from a letter upon the subject written by Mr. Attorney General Stanton on the 28th of February, 1861, to P. Della Torre, Esq., special Counsel of the United States in these cases:
            "I authorize and direct you, as special counsel of the United States to take appeals in all cases in which decisions have been made against the United States, where appeals have not been entered - and request you to see that the appeals are entered without delay, and that the transcripts are made out and forwarded to this office, to be entered in the Supreme Court."
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            California land cases.
