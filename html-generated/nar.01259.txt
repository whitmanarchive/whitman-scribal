            F. B. Slingerland,
            Rome, New York.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 16th of March, inst., is received. It is no part of my official duty to vindicate the rights of individual citizens, who have their remedy for any wrongs of which they complain in the ordinary tribunals. If the legislature of Massachusetts have passed an unconstitutional law, I have no doubt the courts of Massachusetts will, on a
                Official action declined. 
            
            proper presentation of the case, so decide, and protect you in any rights, which you may have. If not satisfied with their decision, the Supreme Court of the United States is open, as an appellate tribunal. I am not aware of any laws by virtue of which the United States Government can interfere in such cases, any more than in other cases of private wrongs.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            I return the pamphlet herewith, which you sent me.
