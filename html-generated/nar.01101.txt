           December 10, 1869,
           Hon. G. S. Orth,
           House of Representatives,
           Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            The letter of A. G. Hogeland to you, of December 3, instant, was sent by you to me, with a request that I advise you as to the matters contained in it.
            The question of law whether Internal Revenue officers are entitled to claim shares of fines, penalties, and forfeitures, under the Internal Revenue laws, as informers, has been propounded to me, by the Secretary of the Treasury. I have not yet given any opinion upon it. No claims of this character, nor particular cases, have been referred to, or are pending in, this Office.
            The letter of Mr. Hogeland is herewith returned.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Shares of Internal Rev. officers as informers
