            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of Aug. 30, informing me that a suit brought by one Walker, had been commenced in a State Court of Texas, supposed to be in El Paso county, against Capt. Charles Bentzoni, 25th Infantry, claiming damages for acts understood to have been done by him in the line of his official duty, and requesting that this Department assume the charge of his defence.
            I have accordingly directed the District Attorney for the Western Dist. of Texas to undertake the defence, unless he should learn that Capt. Bentzoni is already provided with counsel; and I have addressed Capt. Bentzoni asking for information in regard to any employment of counsel which he may have personally
            
            Case of Capt. Bentzoni
            Texas
            
            
            
            made, in order that I could ascertain whether it will be proper for me to recognize and compensate the gentleman of his selection.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
