            W. F. Cogswell, Esq.
            Rochester, New York.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 1st inst., I beg leave to say that the case of the United States, v. Mynderse will be entered in the Supreme Court at the next December term. Until that docket is made up, it will be impossible to tell what its position will be upon it, or when it will be likely to be reached. I do not at present see any good reason for applying to the Court to advance it  upon the docket, and unless there is some special reason for so doing, I do not deem it best to do it.
            I remain, yr. obd't serv't,,
            A. T. Akerman, Att'y. Gen'l.
            Case of U. S. vs. Mynderse, Sup. Court.
