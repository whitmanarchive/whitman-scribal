            Hon. J. M. Schofield,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose herewith a certified copy of the "findings of facts," in the case of The U. S. ag't. Sam'l P. Brady, in the Sup. Court of the U. S. on appeal from the Court of Claims; and also a Report upon that case made by Ass't Atty. Gen. Dickey, by which it appears that the claimant offers to remit $2,265:11, from the judgment ag't The U. S., if the Government will dismiss its appeal.
            I have considered the finding of facts and the recommendation of the Ass't. Atty. Gen'l. in charge of cases in the Court of Claims, &amp; concur with him in opinion, that the case may properly be dismissed. I will thank you to advise me whether your Dept. will acquiesce in this suggestion.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney Gen'l.
