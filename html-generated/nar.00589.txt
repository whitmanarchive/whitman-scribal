            Hon. William H. Seward,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to refer you to your letter of the 25th April last, and my reply of 6th May following, with a copy of instructions to the District Attorney, of the same date, relative to a person named Charles Pratt, alias Charles P. Williams, the subject of a communication made to your Department by the United States Consul at Melbourne, in Australia.
            I have just received from Delos Lake, Esq., United States Attorney for the District of California, a letter, with enclosures, from which it appears that the person and his supposed offence have not been heard of by the District Attorney and military authorities of California, nor by the Chief of Police of the city of San Francisco.
            Respectfully, your obd't serv't,
            OH BrowningO. H. Browning
            Attorney General ad interim
