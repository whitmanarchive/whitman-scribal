            D. J. Baldwin, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Galveston, Texas.
            Sir: It is in the opinion of the War Department that a civil suit ag't David V. Whiting for complicity with Capt. W. G. Hodges Quartermaster's Dept. in certain fraudulent transactions, is unavoidable, inasmuch as the responsibility for money rested with Hodges, and therefore you will proceed against Hodges in a criminal prosecution only.
            Very respll'y.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Att'y. Gen'l.
            
            sue Whiting criminally
