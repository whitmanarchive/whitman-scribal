            C. R. Mobley, Esq. U.S. Attorney,
            Key West, Fla.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 21st ult. is received.
            There is now no detective fund under the control of this Department. Some of the other Departments have such funds, and might perhaps be willing to employ some money in your District, if satisfied that it would detect crimes affecting those Departments. I suggest that you state somewhat more specifically what is the class of crimes which you think could be detected by those means.
            detective business. 
            Very respectfully
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
