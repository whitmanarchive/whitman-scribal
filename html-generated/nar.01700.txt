            Hon. J. A.J. Creswell,
            Postmaster General.
            Sir:
            I enclose a copy of a letter from Lucius J. Gartrell, Esq. Attorney for Thomas G. Simms, who is defendant in a suit and an indictment in the District Court of the Northern District of Georgia, for Criminal defalcation as Postmaster at Atlanta.
            Unless I should learn that the contrary is your wish, I shall inform Mr. Gartrell that I know no
            case of Post office crime
            
            
            
            reason for interfering with the regular course of law either in the civil or criminal case.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c
            A. T. Akerman
            Attorney General
