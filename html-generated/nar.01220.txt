            Hon. John Pool,
            U. S. Senate,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of yesterday is just received. I can give you no official opinion upon the subject; but it is now under judicial consideration, having been argued before Judge Clifford of the Supreme Court of the United States, in September last, and he having retained it for advisement. I suppose the Internal Revenue officers are waiting for that decision to govern their action. Perhaps you could learn from Judge Clifford when the question will be decided. I return to you Judge Dick's letter, which you enclosed.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            opinion declined.
