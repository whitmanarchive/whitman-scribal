            Hon. C. Cole,
            U. S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return the letter of Mr. Benton left by you in the Department this morning, and to say, that on the 6th inst. the Attorney of the United States for California was directed by me to report upon the case, stating the legal questions involved, and his opinion as to the propriety of dismissing or continuing the appeal.—I will communicate with you further upon the subject, after the receipt of the Attorney's reply.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney Gen'l.
            
            certain case in California
