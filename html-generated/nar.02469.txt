            P. S. Wilson, Esq.
            Cheyenne, Wyoming Terr.
            Sir:
            Your telegram of this date is received. There are three Judges for Wyoming, and one
                of them ought to be permanently present in the District which embraces Cheyenne. I
                have sent a copy of your telegram to the Hon. J. H. Howe, Chief Justice, and I trust
                there is no cause of complaint—or, if there be cause, it will be promptly
                removed.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman
            Att'y. Gen'l.
            Wyoming Terr.
