            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt for your letters of the 28th of March last, and of the 8th instant, and to state in reply that the title-papers relating to the proposed purchase by the United States, of certain lots from the Frankfort, (Kentucky,) Cemetery Company, have been examined, and that an Opinion thereon, by the Attorney General ad interim will shortly be transmitted to the War Department. The communication of the Q. M. General enclosed in your letter of the 28th March, is herewith returned.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            J. M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
