            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            Referring to the letter of Oct. 4, 1871, from the Acting Secretary of State, to me in relation to an alleged outrage upon the Consul of Spain at Key West, Florida, I have the honor to transmit herewith the copy of a letter from the District Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, dated Nov. 21, 1871, with its enclosures—all relating to that subject.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            Spanish Consul case.
