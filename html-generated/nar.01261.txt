            Messrs. Hendricks, Hord &amp; Hendricks,
            Indianapolis, Ind.
            Gentlemen:
            I have received what purports to be a copy of a citation in a writ of error in a suit in which John S. Williams, Collector, is plaintiff, and Wm. F. Reynolds, agent, &amp;c. defendant, returnable "on the first Monday in December next"— but is not dated. I desire to ask of you whether this writ is returnable on the first Monday of December 1870, or 1869.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l
            Certain suit, &amp;c.
