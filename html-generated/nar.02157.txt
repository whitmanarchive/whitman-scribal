            Hon. Noah Davis,
            U. S. Attorney,
            New York, N. Y.
            Sir:
            Will you inform me of the present condition of the prosecutions against the persons knowknown as "General Jordan" and "General Ryan," who have been indicted in your District for violation of the Neutrality-Laws? In which
            Gen's Jordan &amp; Ryan's cases
            N. Y.
            
            
            
            
            Court, and at what time, were the indictments found? Are the defendants under arrest? Why have they not been tried? Please state any other facts showing the condition of these cases.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
