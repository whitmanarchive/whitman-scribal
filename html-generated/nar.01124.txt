           Hon. Willard Warner,
           U. S. Senate.
           Sir:
           I neglected to take a memorandum of the Circuit Court in the 5th Circuit which you informed me was to meet on the 27th inst. There appears to be no regular term commencing on that date. I will thank you for precise information as to the time and place of meeting of the Court, to enable me to telegraph to the Marshal in relation to its adjournment.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
            U. S. Circuit Court, 5th Circuit
