           Your letter of the 25th ultimo, requesting a direction to the U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri to enter a nolle prosequi in a criminal case pending in his District against James Neal, yourself, and others, has been carefully considered.

       Very respectfully,    
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            official action declined
