            Louis Janni, Esq.
            New Orleans, La.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 31st ultimo.
            Your request that a certain list of grants of land made in Florida by the Spanish Government, may be procured from you either from ? Havana, or from some other quarter.
            You do not show me that this list is necessary in maintaining any interest of the United States in charge of this Department, and therefore I do not conceive it to be the duty of this Department to undertake the labor of procuring it.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain list.
