            Charles C. Beaman, Esq.
            Examiner of Claims, &amp;c.
            Sir:
            Some weeks ago, I referred to you for an opinion a question from the State Department on the subject of the vessels entitled to carry the flag of the United States.
            Desiring to close up the pending business of this Department before I leave it on the 10th proximo, I request that you will submit to me as soon as possible your opinion on the matter for my action under the Fourth section of the Act to establish the Department of Justice.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            question of flag U.S.
