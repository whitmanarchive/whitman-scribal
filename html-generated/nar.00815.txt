            Messrs. C. E. Hooker,
            F. Anderson,
            T. J. Wharton,
            Jackson, Miss.
            Gentlemen:
            I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22d inst. inquiring into indictments supposed to be pending ag't Mr. Jefferson Davis—&amp; in reply have to state that this office has no information of any pending since the dismissal of those in the Dist. of Virginia at the last term of the U. S. Court in Richmond.
            I transmit herewith a copy of the instructions issued from this office to all Attorneys of the U. S. dated Dec. 26, 1868, in relation to indictments for treason, for offences occurring during the late civil war.
                
                Jeff'n Davis's case.
                
                
            So far as known, these instructions have been uniformly complied with, and this office has no information of any such prosecution now pending in any Dist. of the United States.
            Very resp. yours.
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
