            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Dear Sir:
            I have this morning received a dispatch from District Attorney Davis of New York in which he advises me that in his opinion the conviction of Hodge of a felony, by court martial, will not render him incompetent to testify against PolhamusPolhaimus and Jackson.
            Very resp'lly,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            Hodge.
