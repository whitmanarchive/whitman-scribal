            Almon W. Griswold,
            Counsellor at Law,
            New York,
            Sir:
            In the case of Barney, Collector, vs. Schneider—No. 416, December Term, 1867—we have received, from the Solicitor of the Treasury, a copy of a letter addressed to him by Mr. Secretary McCulloch, of which I enclose a copy for your information. It will be observed that the Treasury Department declines to recommend that the cause be advanced on the docket.
            Respectfully, your obd't serv't,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
            [copy enclosed]
