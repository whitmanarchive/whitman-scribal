I have the honor to enclose herewith a number of papers relating to a part of the town site of Deer Lodge City, Montana Territory, which it is proposed to purchase, for the United States, for the erection of a Penitentiary thereon—and to request that you will examine them, and furnish me with such information as may be in the possession of your office touching the condition of the title to the land in question, and return the papers therewith.
Very Respectfully, your obedient servant,
John M. Binckley,
Assistant Attorney General.
