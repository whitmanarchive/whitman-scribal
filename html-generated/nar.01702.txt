            Feb. 8, 1871.
            Hon. James G. Blaine,
            Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            On the 9th of January last, the House of Representatives passed a resolution requesting the Attorney General to furnish the House, "A statement of all persons, with their places of residence, who have been arrested in Virginia, since the first day of January, 1868, for violations of Internal Revenue laws—showing in each case whether the person arrested was indicted—and if so whether he was tried—and in cases where order of noble prosequi were entered, a statement of the grounds of the same,—and in the cases of those persons who were arrested and not indicted, a statement of the authority by whom they were discharged."
            Having in this office at that time no information upon the subject, I immediately transmitted to the U. S. Attorney, and to the Marshal of the District of Virginia
            certain statement requested by U. S.H. R.
            
            
            
            copies of the Resolution, and called upon those officers to furnish the desired information. Their Reports have been received, and I herewith transmit copies of them, to the House, as all the information which I am able to obtain upon the subject of the Resolution. The paper marked "A" is a copy of the Report of the District Attorney. That marked "B" is a copy of the Report of the Marshal.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
