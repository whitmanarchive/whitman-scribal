            James N. Kerns, Esq.
            U. S. Marshal,
            Philadelphia, Penn.
            Sir:
            Upon an application to the Secretary of the Interior, Hon. C. Delano, to exercise his influence that Mr. J. A. Gregory, son of the late Marshal, shall be retained in his present position, Mr. Delano has referred the matter to my "favorable consideration."
            I do not know what is the position that Mr. Gregory holds, or what his fitness is for it, and therefore have no personal wishes on the subject, and content myself with advising you of the recommendation of Mr. Delano.
            Very resp'lly, A. T. Akerman, Att'y. Gen'l.
