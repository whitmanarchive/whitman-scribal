            A. B. Maynard Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Detroit, Mich.
            Sir:
            I herewith transmit the copy of a letter to the Chairman of the Light House Board, from Capt. G. L. Gillespie, of the Engineers and Light House Establishment, reporting that there have been trespasses upon Government bounds near the Light House, on the north pier of the entrance to the harbor of Monroe, Michigan.
            You will ascertain the facts, and the names of the offending parties, and proceed against them civilly or criminally, or in both ways, if you find the facts to warrant such proceedings. If you find that the trespasses are of such a nature as to authorize summary proceedings by the Marshal, you will advise him accordingly.
            If, after inquiry into the facts, you entertain doubts upon the law, you will report to this Department for further instructions.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            trespasses on U. S. property, Mich.
