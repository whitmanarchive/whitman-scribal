            Hon. C. M. Hawley,
            Associate Justice,
            Salt Lake City, Utah.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 14th inst. wherein you request leave of absence for thirty or forty days from the 1st of December next.
            You are aware of the Executive order relative to the absence of the Judicial officer from the Territories.—In view, however, of the cause for which this absence is needed, namely, for the purpose of visiting Chicago, to look
            
            leave of absence.
            
            
            
            after your interests in that city, and also of your statement that such absence will not be detrimental to the interests of the Government, there being no courts in session at that time, a leave of absence is hereby granted you for thirty days from the date above mentioned.
            I regret to learn of your losses in Chicago, but hope they may not be as great as you anticipate.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
