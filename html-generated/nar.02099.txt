            Mr. R. W. Lowell,
            Jerome, Mo.
            Sir:
            Your letter to the President of the 13th instant, proposing to arrest Quantrell, has been referred to this Department.
            I am not aware of any appropriation out of which the expenses of such an ap       could be paid by the U. S. Government. I am not informed that there is any prosecution against the party in the U. S. Courts. If he is amenable to justice in the courts for crimes against the State laws, you should apply to the Executive authorities of Kansas.

            Very resp'lly,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Att'y Gen'l.
            
            concerning Quantrell
