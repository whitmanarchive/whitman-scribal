            R. J. Stevens, Esq.
            Sec. of Committee on Appropriations
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ult. desiring to know whether there is any, and, if any, what information of the records of this office relative to the case of the schooner Sybil, captured as prize. There is no such information to be obtained from any thing among the records or files of this office. The case never came into the Supreme Court of the United States by appeal from the prize court.
            I am aware, however, that the case of a schooner Sybil and cargo was adjudicated in December, 1864, by Judge Betts, in the Southern District of New York. A report of the decision of Judge Betts will be found in Blatchford's prize cases, p. 615.
            It appears from that decision that a decree of acquittal of the Schooner &amp; cargo, with costs, was entered by the Dist. Judge.—From that decree, no appeal seems to have been taken. Of course, the committee will be able to find the proofs in preparatorio, and the papers found on board of the captured vessel, in the custody of the Dist. Court at New York.
            Those proofs and papers will disclose the character &amp; circumstances of the case; but I observe that they
            
            
            are very fully commented upon in the opinion of Judge Betts.
            I presume the case to which I have referred is the one which is the subject‑matter of your communication.
            Very respectfully,
            your ob'dt servt,
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
