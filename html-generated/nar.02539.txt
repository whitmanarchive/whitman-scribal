            Franklin, Venango Co, Pa.
            Sir:
            I have consulted with the Solicitor General and acting Attorney General in regard to Proper's case, and he has written to Mr. Swoope, to inform us of the facts, in it, and his reasons for not continuing it, in accordance with his promise to you in his letter of the 10th instant. Upon his reply, I will further advise you about it.
            I enclose Mr. Swoope's letter.
            Your very obd't serv't,
            Clement Hugh Hill,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
            Proper's case
