            Pueblo, C. T.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 14th instant, asking for leave of absence during
                the month of October, and in reply have to inform you that in view of the Executive
                order, a copy of which has been sent to you, and of the great number of complaints
                received at this Department, on account of the absence from their posts of the
                Territorial Judges, the leave asked for cannot be granted.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            declining leave of absence
