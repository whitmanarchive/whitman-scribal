Will you please telegraph orders to the Collector to use every lawful means to protect the witnesses from any interference or assault by the officers and men of the Hornet, and to apply to the commanding officer of the revenue cutter, or of the Frolic, for all necessary aid to insure such protection?
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient serv't,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General
            Case of the "Hornet"
