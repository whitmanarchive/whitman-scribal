            Hon. A. W. Randall,
            Postmaster General.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23d inst. requesting me to instruct the United States Attorney at Knoxville, Tennessee, to defend a suit against the postmaster at that place brought by William Williams, the owner of the post office building for rent of the same whilst in the hands of the military authorities; and to say that I have issued the necessary instructions.
            Very respectfully yours,
            Wm M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
