            D. W. Middleton, Esq.
            Clerk Sup. Court U. S.
            Sir:
            I send transcript of record in Cooley et al. vs. O'Conner. A new citation has been issued and served, and the bill of exceptions has the seal of the Court, and not of the Judge—but I take it that will do.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field, Ass't Attorney Genl.
            (enc.)
            record case of Cooley vs. O'Conner
