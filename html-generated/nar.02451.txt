           Sep. 6, 1871.
            His Excellency George D. Woods,
            Salt Lake City, Utah.
            Sir:
            I have received, through your reference, the letter addressed to you dated the 28th ultimo, by U. S. Marshal Patrick, covering a communication addressed to him, under date of the 19th ultimo, by Col Trobri and, commanding at Camp Douglas, inviting his attention to the civil prisoners confirmed at that post, you refer these letters to me, and express the hope that some arrangement can be made by which such prisoners can be kept at the Territorial Penitentiary until their trial—there being no available county prison—and the penitentiary being the only place in which they can be safely kept.
            By the contract entered into by you and Marshal Patrick, for the subsistence and safe-keeping of Territorial convicts, it is agreed that the Territory "shall pay to the Government of the United States, the sum of one dollar and fifty cents for each and every day for each prisoner, so long as the said prisoners shall be so confined." This agreement has reference to persons who have been convicted in the Territorial Courts, and
                Prisoners, pay, &amp;c. in Utah. 
            
            sentenced to imprisonment thereby. If, however, the Territorial authorities will pay for keeping persons held for trial, at the same rate, and upon the same conditions, as for those specified in the contract, I know of no objection to their being placed in the Penitentiary, and under the control of the U. S. Marshal. I do not feel authorized to direct the Marshal to receive these parties arrested for violations of the Territorial laws, unless some arrangement can be made for the payment of their subsistence.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
