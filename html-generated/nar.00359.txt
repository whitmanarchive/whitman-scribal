            Hon. Schuyler Colfax,

            Sir:
            In accordance with a requirement in the Act of Congress of March 2, 1867, entitled "An Act making Appropriations for the current and Contingent Expenses of the Indian Bureau," by which it is made my duty to examine and report to Congress upon the condition of the Indian Trust Funds, stocks, investments, &amp;c. and to offer certain suggestions, I have the honor to send herewith the result of such examination and to state that what proceedings, &amp;c. relative to said stocks and investments, are in my opinion legal and advisable.
            With the highest respect,
            I remain, yours,
            Henry Stanbery
            Attorney General.
