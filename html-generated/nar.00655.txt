            Sir:
            I have the honor to inform you that I received a telegram from the United States Marshal at Key West, stating that Judge Boynton refuses a writ of habeas corpus in the cases of Mudd and others.
            Respectfully, your obd't serv't,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Acting Attorney General.
