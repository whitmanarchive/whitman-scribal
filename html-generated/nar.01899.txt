            June 5, 1869.
            Hon. B. F. Butler,
            Gloucester, Mass.
            Sir:
            A copy of the pleadings in the following suits ag't you, pending in the Courts at New York City has been sent to this office, with the request that the Attorney Gen'l will appear in them for you, and defend them—pursuant to the first section of the Act of Congress approved July 27th, 1868.
            These suits are entitled as follows:
            1—John H. Lester,
            vs. Benj. F. Butler.
            2—Henry N. Siebrecht,
            vs. Benj. F. Butler.
            3—Henry A. Tilden,
            vs. Benj. F. Butler.
            4—Alfred Kearney,
            vs. Benj. F. Butler.
            5—John H. Lester,
            vs. Benj. F. Butler.
            I desire to learn from you the names of attorneys and counsel whom you might think it desirable to employ. Messrs. Develin, Miller &amp; Trull, 82 Nassau street, New York City, appear as defendants' attorneys in each of these suits. Do you think them suitable persons to be employed by this office on behalf of the defence?— and do you think it best that other counsel be employed to assist them?
            I should be pleased to receive any statements of fact, &amp; suggestions,
                
                
            from you, that may tend to make the defence successful.
            Very Resp. y'r obd't serv't,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
