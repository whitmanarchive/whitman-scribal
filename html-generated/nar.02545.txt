            November 1, 1871.
            Mr. Geo. W. Ashburn,
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 6th of October. On account of your family, I should be delighted to be able to favor your release. But in official action I am bound by public considerations; and I have not been able to see how you can be released except upon a principle
            
            declining pardon
            
            
            
            that would work serious detriment to the public service. The best atonement which you can make for the serious error in which you fell, is a submissive suffering of the sentence—with a hearty resolution to act uprightly in the future.
            Respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
