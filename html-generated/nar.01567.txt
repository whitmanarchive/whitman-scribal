            Hon. Columbus Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose, with accompanying papers, two deeds of land, originally patented to the father of Joseph Robinson, the grantor, and to request that you cause the patent to be examined, and advise the Department whether there is any reason why the approval of the President should not be given, as requested.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            and Acting Attorney General.
            certain land patents
