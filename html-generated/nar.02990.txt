            Hon. Thos L. Smith,
            First Auditor of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to the President by the Hon. Humphrey H. Leavitt, tendering his resignation of the Office of District Judge of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio.
            In tendering his resignation, Judge Leavitt makes it known that he accepts the benefits and provisions of the fifth section of the Act of Congress, approved April 11, 1867, entitled "An Act to amend the Judicial system of the United States, 10 Statutes, p. 14. As the salary accounts of the U.S. Judges are stated in your Office, I thought
            
            Judge Leavitt's resignation Ohio.
            
            
            
            it would be proper to transmit to you a copy of Judge Leavitt's letter of resignation.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
