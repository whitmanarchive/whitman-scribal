            Your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter from District Attorney Hazelton, in relation to forwarding the mandates in certain cases, mentioned, has been received; and I have to-day written to Mr. Hazelton that I shall move that the mandates be issued as soon as the rules of the Court will allow.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            and Acting Attorney General.
            certain Sup. Ct. mandates
