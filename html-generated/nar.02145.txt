            E. S. Kearney, Esq. U.S. Marshal,
            Washington, Terr.
            Sir:
            I am informed (indeed I think the information came in a letter from you some months ago,) that John R. Smith
            
            
                
            who has been found guilty of murder in your Territory, has broken jail, and has escaped. If such is the fact, and he is still at large, will you immediately transmit to me your affidavit that such is the fact? State the time and material circumstances of his escape. It is important to have it before his case shall be reached in the Supreme Court.           
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.  
            
            J. R. Smith escaped felon,
            Wash. Terr.
