            C. L. Robinson, Esq.
            U.S. Commissioner,
            Jacksonville, Fla.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, and to inform you that this Department does not distribute to U.S. Commissioners or others the "Statutes at Large of the United States." The law places the distribution of such books under the control of the Secretary of the Interior—but I am not aware that the law provides for their distribution to U.S. Commissioners.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
            declining books.
