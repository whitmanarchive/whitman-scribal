      Hon. R. C. McCormick,
      Delegate from Arizona,
      House of Representatives
      Sir:
      You requested me to inform you if any thing should come to this office to the disadvantage
        of Mr. Phelps, the U.S. Marshal for Arizona.
      Complaint is made that he is out of the District, and has not been faithful in his office.
        His accounts are in a condition which requires explanation. He was in arrears in the early
        part of the year 1869, over nine thousand dollars, and in April of that year asked for an
        additional advance, which was refused until he should account for the balance in his
        hands.
      I learn that he has not so accounted.
      I shall be glad to receive Case of U.S.
          Marshal Phelps, Arizona
         an explanation of the
        matter.
      Very respectfully, &amp;c.
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
