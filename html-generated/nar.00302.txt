G. B. Lamar, Esq.
Savannah, Geo.
Sir:
            In answer to yours of the 4th inst. I have to say that upon application to the Secretary of the Treasury I was informed that your box of papers had been returned by him to the War Department. I have since communicated your request to the Secretary of War ad int., and he declines to surrender any of the papers.
Very respectfully yours,
Henry Stanbery.
