            The Honorable, the Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith papers relating to the pardon of James D. Martin; and upon due consideration of the case, have to say that I see no objection to the return of the warrant of pardon to the Marshal for delivery.
            Very Resp. yours.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
