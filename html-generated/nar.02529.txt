            Wm. Darlington, Esq.
            West Chester, Penn'a.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 9th instant, I beg to say that no printed argument can be submitted in Gray and Darlington until the December term of the Court. Meanwhile, I will look over the case, with either the Attorney or Solicitor General, and let you know our decision.
            I am still disposed, should they approve it, to argue the case in writing, but, under the circumstances I do not feel that I am authorized to promise that it shall be done, without consulting them.
            The confusion of moving into our new offices has prevented an earlier reply to your note.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            C. H. Hill,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
            
            Gray &amp; Darlington
