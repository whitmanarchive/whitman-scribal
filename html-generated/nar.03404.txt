            Hon Geo. L. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, transmitting a copy of a letter from Hon. Noah Davis the Attorney of the United States for the Southern District of New York, addressed to the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue relative to the great difficulties in the District, of disposing, in a speedy and satisfactory manner, of the many cases in the Courts of that District in which the Government is concerned.
            As this is a matter of considerable importance, the attention of Congress will be called to the subject by the Attorney General in his next Annual Report, and recommendation will be made therein to Congress to the end that some legislation looking to the removal of the
            
            U.S. cases in N. Y. city
                
            
                
            difficulties and evils complained of may be had.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
