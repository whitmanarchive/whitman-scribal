            U. S. Attorney,
            Nashville, Tenn.
            Sir:
            I enclose the copy of a return of the Clerk of the U. S. Circuit Court for your District to a certiorari from the Supreme court in the case of The United States, vs. Jesse Thomas, and others.
            You will see that there is matter in this return which calls for explanation from yourself, and this I desire that you will make at once.            

            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General            
            
            explain return
            Tenn.
