            Richmond, Va.
            Sir:
            The Attorney General directs me to say, in reply to your telegram of this date, that prosecutions in the District Courts of the United States are devolved solely upon the U. S. Dist. Attorneys, unless Assistant Counsel are appointed by the Head of one of the Executive Departments.
            Very Resp. yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clerk.
