            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            Referring to your communication to this Department of June 22, 1871, I have the honor to inform you that the District Attorney for Nebraska reports that no such persons as Swift, Peters, and Crane, the obligors in the bonds, described as of Omaha, Neb., can be found in Nebraska.
            If you have any information showing the residence of these parties I will thank you to communicate it, in order that suit may be commenced in the proper District.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            persons not found
            Neb.
