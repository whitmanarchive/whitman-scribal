            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit herewith copies of telegrams received last night and this morning from the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York.
            These telegrams have been communicated to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Navy has been requested to keep the "Whiting" safely at the Navy Yard in Brooklyn.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney Gen'l.
