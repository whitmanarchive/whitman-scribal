            Dec. 6, 1871.
            Mr. Jacob D. Enos,
            No. 1416 I street,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of yesterday arrived so late that I have not time to say more by way of reply than that I most heartily wish you success in your objects. I do not believe that the violent people of the South will venture to molest you now for exercising the right of a citizen. If they do, it shall be no fault of mine if they are not brought to justice.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            affairs south.
