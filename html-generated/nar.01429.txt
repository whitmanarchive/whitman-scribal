            E. P. Norton, Esq.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I have considered the subject mentioned in your letter of the 18th inst., and in the personal interview which I had with you at the 
                non-retainer as Counsel 
            
            time of its delivery. Upon examination of the Act of June 22, 1870, establishing the Department of Justice, (Sec. 14,) I find that no compensation can be paid by the United States for professional services in the Supreme Court, or Court of Claims, to persons not belonging to this Department. It is therefore proper for me to give you notice that I cannot consider you as retained by this Department in the case referred to.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Ackerman,
            Attorney General.
