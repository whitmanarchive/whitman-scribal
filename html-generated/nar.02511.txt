            D. J. Baldwin, Esq.
            Houston, Texas.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury under date of the 22d ultimo, by J. B. McCreary, Esq. Collector of Customs at Indianola Texas, relative to a suit brought against one of his deputies, Mr. Johnson, for acts done in the line of his official duty.
            I have to request that you will take charge of the defense of this suit, for which service a reasonable compensation, to be determined by this Department, will be allowed. Should it, however, from any cause, be impossible for you to appear for the defendant, you will designate to this Department some person who can take the oath, and is in other respects qualified, when a commission will be sent to him.
            I shall be pleased to have

            your views as to the compensation that should be allowed in this case.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
