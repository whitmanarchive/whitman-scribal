            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 4th instant enclosing the account, amounting to $75, of S. M. Ashenfelter, Esq. U.S. Dist. Attorney for New Mexico, for services rendered in investigating the claim of Messrs. Perea &amp; Co. of N. M. for the War Dept., and requesting my views as to the reasonableness of the same. I am of opinion that the amount charged is reasonable. I will call your attention to the 3d Sec. of the Act to provide for taking testimony to be used before Departments, (16 U.S. Stat. 412,) under which Act the service of Mr. Ashenfelter seems to have been rendered. It does not appear from the files of this office that the notice to the Attorney General required in said section has been given.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman, Attorney Gen'l.
