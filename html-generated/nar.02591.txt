            Nov. 15, 1871.
            Lieut. J. S. McEwan,
            Lieutenant, 4th Artillery, U. S. A.
            Raleigh, N. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 28th ultimo, with its enclosures, has been received. I agree with you that there is no good reason for taking Mr. Shotwell to Raleigh at present. Indeed I do not incline to invite, though of course
            Mr. Shotwell.
                N. C.
                
                I should not refuse, confession and statements from the prisoners at Albany. The prospects now are that the secrets of the Ku Klux in North Carolina can be otherwise found out; and these persons might have a sort of claim to some mitigation of their sentence, if their statements were encouraged.
            An unusual press of business prevented an earlier answer to your letter.
            Very respectfully,
             A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            P. S. you speak of a letter from Shotwell to myself; but I do not find it among the enclosures.
