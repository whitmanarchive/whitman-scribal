            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            In pursuance of your letter of the 23d instant, referring the communication of Major Elliott, Engineer Secretary of the Light House Board. I have directed the District Attorneys of the Eastern District of New York and of Rhode Island, to render any needed professional service in acquiring titles to Light House sites at Barber's Point, New York, and at Sassafras Point, and Fuller's and Punham's Rocks, respectively, in Rhode Island. I have also directed those officers to enter into communication  with Lieut. Col. J. C. Woodruff, whose letter you enclosed to me.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            titles to Light House sites
