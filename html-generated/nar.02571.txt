            Nov. 9, 1871.
            Capt. Charles Bentzoni,
            25th U. S. Infantry,
            Fort Bliss, Texas.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of Sept. 26 last, and in pursuance of the request of the Secretary of War have ordered the payment of the account for counsel fees, in the case of Walker against yourself from the funds of this Department.—
                Though there is some irregularity in this proceeding, it appears to me that the circumstances justify the payment.
            Capt. Bentzoni's case
            see p. 48 ante             
                Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
