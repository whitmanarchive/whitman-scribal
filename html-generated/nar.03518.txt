            Hon. J. A. J. Creswell,
            Postmaster General.
            Sir:
            I have received a letter from Mr. C. Cochran, Jr., Superintendent of Mail Depredations, dated the 8th instant, enclosing an account of George M. Southworth, Special Agent of the Post office Department, for $25 50/100 for legal services in a preliminary examination of L.
            
            defective acc't of $25 50/100
            
            
            
            Whitmore, late a Route Agent, prosecuted for robbing the mail.
            I enclose the account without my certificate for the reasons that it does not show where the services were rendered, or any circumstances establishing the impossibility of obtaining the services of the District Attorney.
            I think aslo that it should appear, either by a communication, or some statement or certificate, that you, as the Head of the Post Office Department, are satisfied of the propriety of the expenditure.
            If these defects are supplied, I will promptly give the certificate required by law.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
