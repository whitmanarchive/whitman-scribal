            Hon. John W. Kingman,
            Associate Justice,
            Cheyenne, Wyoming Terr.
            My dear Sir:
            I have received yours of the 18th instant.
            I remember you well as a schoolfellow at Exeter, and although I cannot be governed in official action by any such considerations, it will give me great pleasure if things so turn out that I can gratify an early friend consistently with official duty.
            I shall be pleased to hear
            
                letter answered
            
            
            from you, and to learn how the world has gone with you since we parted at our old nursery, Exeter. I have occasionally heard of you, but never have met you. Thirty-one years must have accumulated large experience for you, as the same period has for me, and I shall always take pleasure in hearing from you, and in seeing you, if you come where I happen to be.
            Very truly,
            A. T. Akerman.
