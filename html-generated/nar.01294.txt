           John A. Wills, Esq.
           Washington, D. C.
           Sir:
           In the matter of the application of N. S. Murphy for instructions to the United States Attorney for California to file a bill to vacate a land patent in which you appear for other persons, said to be interested, I desire, if you have any evidence touching the points on which, at the oral hearing before me, it was suggested that evidence could be produced, that it may be furnished on or before two weeks from next Monday, which will be the 18th instant. Unless it is furnished on or before that time, I shall regard the hearing as closed.
           Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Case of N. S. Murphy Cal.
