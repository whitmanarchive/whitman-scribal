           Wm. S. Huntington, Esq.
           Cashier of the First National Bank,
           Washington, D. C.
           Sir:
           Your letter of the 15th of December last to the Secretary of War, in relation to a judgment in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, awarding to H. B. Titus a moiety of certain confiscated property, has been referred to this office.
           Under instructions from the Attorney General, the District Attorney of Georgia, in April last, moved to vacate an order of the Court in 1868 adjudging Titus to be an informer. In May last the Attorney General was urged to direct that this motion should be withdrawn. He declined to give this direction—and no new facts having been presented to me, I do not feel at liberty to interfere with the action of my predecessor. It is proper that the question raised by this motion should receive a legal adjudication—and this will no doubt be rendered as soon as the matter can be disposed of in the usual course of the court.
            Very resp'lly, &amp;c
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            case of H. B. Titus informer Georgia
