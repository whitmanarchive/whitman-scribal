            D. W. Middleton, Esq.
            Clerk Supreme Court United States.
            Sir:
            I send you enclosed herewith a certificate of the clerk of the District Court of the United States for the District of California, who canotcannot find in his office a mandate of the Supreme Court in the case of The United States, vs. José Maria Alriso, although it seems the mandate was filed in the District Court on the 1st of June, 1869.
     I send also a letter of the United States Attorney for California on the subject.       Will you be kind enough, if in accordance with the practice of your office, to have issued a second mandate,
         
         Duplicate mandate requested
         
              
              or duplicate of the first, and send it to this office?
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
