            J. R. Beckwith, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            New Orleans, La.
            Sir:

            I herewith return the transcript of the record in the case of the United States, vs. J. W. Burbridge, &amp; Co. et al. which was received at this Department under cover of your letter of 21st of September last.
            Upon examination of the transcript it is discovered that the writ of error is defective in respect to the parties. Thus, it appears that the suit was brought by the United States in the Circuit Court against "J. W. Burbridge &amp; Co., and Thomas J. Harris," whereas the writ recites that the proceedings are between the United States and "J. W. Burbridge &amp; Co.," omitting the name Thomas D. Harris, one of the defendants. This is a fatal defect. (Lee Miller V. McKensie, 10 Wall, 582; also the case of the Protector, 11 Wall, 82.)
            In view of the foregoing it is
                
                case of U. S. vs. Burbridge et al
                sue out new writ,
                La.
                
                
            
            deemed useless to file the transcript in the Supreme court under the writ. You are accordingly requested to sue out a new writ, taking care that all the parties whose interests are to be affected by the judgment be properly named therein—and also to procure the issue and service of a citation thereon upon all the parties respectively.
            I am sir, with respect, &amp;c. &amp;c
            B. H. Bristow,
            Solicitor General.
