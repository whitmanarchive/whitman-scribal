            Hon. Wm. Lawrence,
            of Committee on Appropriations,
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            The Attorney General, as he was about to leave for Georgia, requested me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th inst, enclosing a copy of a bill to secure indemnity to The United States in certain cases—and to say that he has given the matter due examination, that he approves of the bill, and has no suggestions to make in reference to it.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            and Acting Attorney General.
            Certain Bill approved
