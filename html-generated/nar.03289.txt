            To the President.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit the copy of a communication which the Hon. George E. Spencer, Senator from Alabama, has sent to this Department.
            The official position of the writer
            
            
            
            is such that I feel bound to submit his letter for your consideration. I will add, however, that I am not aware of any official delinquency in the Marshal. He was appointed last year upon the strong recommendation of Mr. Warner. There is a vagueness in the present charges which somewhat impairs their force.
            I feel it a duty to say that the peremptory manner in which Mr. Spencer expresses his wishes, takes away all reason for complying with them, except such as springs from their intrinsic merits.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            case of U.S. marshal in Fla. Ala.
