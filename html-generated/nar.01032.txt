            Messrs. Anthon &amp; Leeds,
            Counsellors at Law, New York.
            Gentlemen:
            Your letter of the 15th inst. is received, and only requires a reply because you seem to assume that no investigation of your subject of complaint has been made. It was the purpose of my letter of the 13th inst. to inform you politely of a result, and I did not then propose, and do not now propose, to discuss with you the process by which that result was reached.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            see p. 79 ante.
