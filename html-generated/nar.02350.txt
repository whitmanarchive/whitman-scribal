            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the papers received under cover of your letter to the Attorney General of the 6th of June last, concerning the Title to a tract of land in Schoolcraft County, Michigan, desired for a Beacon site to mark the East Channel of Grand Island Harbor, Lake Michigan, and described as Lot 2, in Section 24, Township 47 N., Range 19 W., containing 44.69/100 acres.
         From an examination of these papers, I am of opinion that the proposed conveyance from Herman D. Walbridge will vest in the United States a good, and valid Title to the said premises.   
            I am, Sir,
            Very Respectfully,
            John M. Binckley,
            Acting Attorney General.
