            Sir:
            In reply to your request for the return of a letter transmitted to this Office in June last, I am instructed by the Attorney General to say that papers forwarded to this office relating to appointments to office, or the prevention of appointments, are considered to belong to the files of the Department, and it is against our rules to permit them to be taken therefrom.
            Very resp. yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
            declining to return papers.
