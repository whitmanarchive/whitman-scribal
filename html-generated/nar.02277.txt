            C. K. Davis, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            St. Paul, Minn.
            Sir:
            Enoch Totten, Esq. of this city has transmitted your account for fees for services in connection with the proceedings on the subject of the canal at Duluth. I am not advised that your services in the business are terminated. In my letter of the 29th of August last I directed you, in pursuance of a suggestion from the War Department, to confer with Mr. Carpenter upon the preparation of the bond. Mr. Carpenter informs me that you have not done so.
            Will you explain how this is,—and how the matter stands?
            Upon the completion of the required service, your compensation will be promptly paid.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
            acc't for services &amp;c Duluth Canal case, Minn.
