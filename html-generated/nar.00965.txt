            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I think the case stated in the telegram of Francis C. Barlow, U. S. Marshal for New York, of which you enclose me a copy in your letter of to-day, just received, is one clearly within the range of the instructions given to him, and the District Attorney; and my own judgment would be that it would be wise to use military force to seize the unlawful military expedition to which he refers,— retaining the parties, however, no longer than might be necessary to effectually break it up.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar, Attorney General
            Unlawful Expedition.
            See letter C. Index p. 12.
