      Hon. Geo. Vickers,
      U.S. Senate,
      Sir:
      I have received your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing certain papers relating to the
        prosecution against William H. Lyons, in the District of Virgina. The subject had  been brought to my notice
        before, by a rumor that there had been remissness on the part of the prosecution. This led
        me to call upon the District Attorney of Virginia for the facts. Under date of the 20th
        ultimo, he gave a full history of the case. The material part of it is this: That he applied
        to the Collector at Norfolk for information upon the subject. The Collector reported that
        there was no evidence in his office tending to convict the accused, and that he knew of none
        existing—and that a careful investigation of the matter had been made by the naval
        authorities of Norfolk, which exonerated the accused. This information having been
        communicated to the Solicitor of the Treasury, that officer suggested to the District
        Attorney that a nolle prosequi be entered in the case, which was
        done on the 5th Day of December last.
      As your correspondent, Mr. Booth, conceives that facts in his knowledge inculpate Mr.
        Lyons, I have directed the District Attorney of Virginia to apply to Mr. Booth for
        information upon the subject, and if satisfactory evidence of guilt shall be produced, to
        renew the prosecution.
      Case of Wm. H. Lyons, Va.
      Very respectfully, &amp;c.
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
