            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to inform you, in answer to yours of March 26th, asking if, in any case, the statute of limitations is waived as a special defence to cases in the Court of Claims, that he has no power to waive that defence, on behalf of the United States.
            Very Resp. yours,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Ass't. Atty. Gen.
