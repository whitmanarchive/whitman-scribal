            Hon. A. E. Borie,
            Secretary of the Navy.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of two letters dated respectively May 1st and May 3d inst, the latter asking for a copy of the opinion referred to by Mr. Solicitor Bolles, in his letter of the 29th ult, namely, the opinion of Hon. Mr. Browning, Attorney General, ad interim, in the case of Paymaster Caspar Schenck, communicated to the President in June last. The letter of Mr. Bolles was sent to your office, and no copy was retained.
            I do not find in the Record Book of Opinions any such opinion as you ask for, and I do not know that the opinion desired was more particularly described in the letter of Mr. Bolles. I send, however,
            
            
            
            a copy of an opinion given by Mr. Browning to the President on June 15th last, in the case of Charles Murray, a Paymaster in the Navy, thinking that perhaps this may be the opinion desired. If not, and you will make more particular reference to the opinion wanted, I will at once send a copy of it to you.
            Very Resp. yours,
            W. A. Field,
            Act'g Attorney General.
