            Hon. E. T. Merrick,
            New Orleans, La.
            Sir:
            The case of Edward J. Gay &amp; others, vs. The United States, will probably be reached in its order on the docket during the second week of the term, or at any rate, during the third week. Under these circumstances if you desire to argue the case in
            case in Sup. Court. 
            
            
            
            
            writing you had better send on your argument at once. Otherwise there will be no opportunity to do so.
            I remain, your very ob't serv't,
            Clement Hugh Hill,
            Assistant Attorney General.
