            Gen. E. D. Townsend,
            Ass't. Adjutant Gen'l.
            Sir:
            I am in receipt of your letter of the 12th inst., and although, as you are aware, I am not at liberty to give an official opinion to any officer of the War Department, except the head of it, I will unofficially say, in reply to your inquiry, that if a judgment against an individual in the State of Vermont carries interest by the laws of that State, it should be allowed the plaintiff in the case of Hiram Walker against Cyrus R. Crane, late Provost Marshal in the first District of Vermont.—I do not know certainly whether, by the laws of Vermont, a judgment carries interest; but it does in Massachusetts, and several other States, with the laws of which I am acquainted. This question can, however, be well answered by the counsel of the plaintiff, Mr. Senator Edmunds, who is learned in the law of Vermont.
            Very Respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar.
