      Hon. A. 
          Pleasonton
          Pleasanton
        ,
      Commissioner Internal Revenue.
      Sir:
      I have received your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing a letter to you  from Charles R. Cornwell,
        attorney for Harris Webster &amp; Company, in which Mr. Cornwell complains that illegal
        costs have been paid by his clients to the District Attorney in California,—and
        requests that such costs may be refunded.
      I know no law which authorizes the commissioner of Internal Revenue to refund costs
        illegally paid to District Attorneys. If there has been an illegal exaction, I presume that
        Mr. Cornwell can advise his clients how to obtain redress.
      letter from C. R. Cornwell, Attorney,
        &amp;c.
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
