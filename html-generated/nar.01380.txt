            Hon. J. W. Douglas,
            Act'g Com'r Internal Revenue.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of to-day, asking the return to the Office of Internal Revenue of the papers in the Internal Revenue case of Joseph S. Finch &amp; Co., with the action of the Attorney General thereon.
            These papers were sent to this office by the Secretary of the Treasury, accompanying his letter of the 28th of February last, with the request for an opinion on the question
                papers returned in J. S. Finch's case
            
            
            of law stated in that letter, and the question is still under consideration by the Attorney General. As the papers came from your office originally, I send them to you enclosed herewith,—but I do not understand the request of the Secretary of the Treasury for an opinion to be withdrawn.
            I am, very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            W. A. Field,
            Act'g Attorney Gen'l.
