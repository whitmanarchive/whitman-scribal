            D. W. Middleton, Esq.
            Clerk of the Supreme Court of The United States.
            Sir:
            I thank you for your letter of the 10th inst. enclosing a transcript in error to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in The United States, plaintiffs in Error, vs. Tarble, in which it does not appear that the writ of error was allowed, or a citation signed, issued and served. I propose to call the attention of the U. S. Attorney for Wisconsin to these defects, and have them remedied by suing out a new writ, or obtaining the allowance of the writ already sued out—and also by having a citation issued and served. What I have to ask is, whether the transcript of the record must be sent back to your office to be kept there, or whether I can have it to send to the U. S. Attorney, to be attached to the new writ of error, if the writ of error is allowed, and then to be sent to your office again with such writ of error, and the citation annexed.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General
            
            certain defective writ of error.
