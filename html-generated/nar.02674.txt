            Dec. 16, 1871.
            Hon. E. H. Durell,
            U.S. Dis't. Judge,
            New Orleans, La.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to inform you that the clerk of the House of Representatives has notified me that, pursuant to the seventh section of the Act of Congress of March 2, 1867, he has selected the "Grand Era," published at Baton Rouge, in place of the "Intelligencer" published at Monroe, in which newspaper the treaties, laws, &amp;c. of the United States are to be published—and that the three official papers in Louisiana are as follows:
            The "Republican," at New Orleans.
            The "German Gazatte" at New Orleans, &amp;
            The "Grand Era" at Baton Rouge.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            official newspapers
            La.
