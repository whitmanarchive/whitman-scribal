            Hon. Wm. H. Seward,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have had under consideration a Memorial from a committee in behalf of the owners of the steamer Meteor, transmitted to me in your letter of the 30th of September. Immediately upon its receipt, I directed the District Attorney of New York to furnish me with a Report of the case, which Report has been received. After a careful consideration of the facts, as disclosed in the Report of the District Attorney, and the opinion of Judge Betts, who tried the case, I do not feel authorized to advise that the prayer of the memorialists should be granted, but, as at present advised, I am of opinion that the case should be allowed to proceed to final determination before the court where it is now pending.
            I have the honor to be,
            with great respect,
            Henry Stanbery
