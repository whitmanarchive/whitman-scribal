            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I transmit enclosed herewith the record of the Court, and other papers, relating to the suit of Henry G. Hubbard against Cornelius Brainard. This seems to be a suit brought against a Collector of Internal Revenue to recover the amount of certain Internal Revenue taxes alleged to have been illegally assessed and collected—and judgment has been rendered against the collector in the State Court of Connecticut, and he has sued out a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the United States. These papers are sent to you with the request that you will inform me whether you desire me to appear for the plaintiff in error in the Supreme Court—and if so, whether the Treasury Department will secure the clerk his fees pursuant to the tenth rule of the Supreme Court of the United States.
            Int. Rev. case H. G. Hubbard ag't C. Brainard
            
            
            Please return the papers after you have examined them.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
