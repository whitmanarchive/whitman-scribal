            Hon. Geo. E. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            Referring to my letter to you of July 19, 1871, in reference to the Internal Revenue Compromise case of   Robbins, I have the honor to state that in consequence of representations made to me by   D. Shoemaker of the good character of the applicants, and of their inability to pay more than part amount of the proposed compromise, I am willing to reconsider the case, if you deem such reconsideration advisable.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Ex. Press B'k 186
            reconsideration of certain Revenue case.
