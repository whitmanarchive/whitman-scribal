            E. Y. Goldsborough, Esq.
          U.S. Marshal,
            Baltimore, Md.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to return the enclosed bill for advertising which was sent to him by the U.S. Attorney of your District, and to say to you that this account should be taxed in court, in the same manner as the accounts for other election expenses were.
            Although the amount is small, the law makes the course indicated above necessary, before it can be submitted for the approval of the President.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
            defective acc't.
