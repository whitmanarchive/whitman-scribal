            at Court of Claims
            Dear Sir:
            A few days since I sent to Mr. Johnston a letter addressed to this Department by A.
                Stowe, Esq. of New York, asking the return of certain papers which he had filed with
                the Attorney General. Will you be kind enough to return Mr. Stowe's letter by
                to-morrow's mail? 
            Very truly yours,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
            return certain letter
