           Hon. J. F. Chaves.
           Delegate from New Mexico,
           Washington, D. C.
           Sir:
           Your letter of this day is just received, in which you state that Chief Justice Palen of New Mexico has requested you to apply to me for a leave of absence, to commence on April 10th next, and to continue for the term of three months. Upon the facts you state, I can see no objection to granting the leave of absence, and shall probably grant it when Chief Justice Palen applies to this Department for it. I prefer to receive a communication directly from him. If he has no place of abode to which to communicate with him, I would be obliged to you to inform me of the mode in which he may be addressed.
          Very respectfully, 
            E. R. Hoar, Attorney General
            leave of absence for Judge Palen New. Mex.
