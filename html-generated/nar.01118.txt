            Hon. Lyman Trumbull,
            Chairman Judiciary Committee
            U. S. Senate.
            Sir:
            By direction of the President I send to your Committee some papers which have been presented to him as charges against Mr. L. B. Eaton, nominated as Marshal of the Western District of Tennessee. These papers are transmitted at the request of persons who wish to oppose the confirmation of Mr. Eaton,—and it is not intended by sending them to the Committee to intimate that the President has any opinion that the charges are well founded, or that Mr. Eaton or his friends cannot furnish a complete answer to them. —On the contrary they have offered to do so, and have been told that the question of the appointment is now exclusively with the Senate.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Nomination of L. B. Eaton before the Senate
