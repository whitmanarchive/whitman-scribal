            Hon. Hamilton Fish.
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            The Senate having requested the President to return to that body its resolution transmitted in my letter of the 13th instant, confirming Bird W. Gray as District Judge of the U.S. for Eastern District of Texas, the President directs me to request that you will return that resolution to this office—and also that the Commission of Mr. Gray may not be made out.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                
            return certain resolution of Senate
