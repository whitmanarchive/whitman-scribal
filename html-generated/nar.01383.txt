            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have been shown by Mr. Lyman a letter addressed to you under date of the 18th inst. by Wm. E. Chandler, Esq., asking you to give instructions to the Collector at Wilmington, N. C. to allow the steamer "Hornet," otherwise called the "Cuba," her armament, &amp;c, to clear for New York.,—and also that you authorize the issue of an American register in the name of Mr. Macias.
            If the vessel has already been delivered to Mr. Macias, pursuant to instructions that have been given to the U. S. Attorney, after the discontinuance of the case, in the manner set forth in those instructions, I know of no reason why a clearance for New York should not be granted.
            Whether the vessel is entitled to an American register I have no knowledge, and express no opinion.
            I have the honor to be,
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Act'g Attorney General.
            
            allow the "Hornet" to clear for New York.
