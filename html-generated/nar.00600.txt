            James A. Morgan, Esq.
            Acting Commissioner of Pensions.
            Sir:
            The enclosed papers have been referred to the Attorney General ad interim for a Report by the President. They relate to a question of the power of the Head of a public office to discontinue communication with a particular person as an attorney or agent for business in such office. The Attorney General, finding the matter ex parte at this stage, will be able to take it up for consideration upon receipt of such statements or remarks as the Commissioner may think fit to offer. To that end I herewith transmit them.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
            
            This letter has been withdrawn and cancelled—is to be considered as never having been written. W. W.
