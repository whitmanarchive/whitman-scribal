      Hon. J. A.J. Creswell,
      Postmaster General,
      Sir:
      I have received a letter from Mr. William F. Bowers, Postmaster at Brownsville, Hart
        County, Georgia, informing me that he has resigned his office, and desiring that his son,
        Bunyan Bowers, be appointed in his place. He adds that his son labors under no disabilities,
        is competent, and will be acceptable to the community.
      He asks me to aid in the Mr. Bowers, P.M.
          Georgia
         premises, which I can only do
        by saying that Mr. Bowers, senior, is well known to me as a respectable man, and firm
        republican, of a good Union stock and record, late a member of the Senate of
        Georgia—and that I give full credit to his representations in the matter. I do not
        know the son, but believe what his father says about him. 
      Very respectfully, &amp;c.
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
