            Mr. Robert H. Knox,
            Montgomery, Ala.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the first instant, and also a letter from the District Attorney upon the same subject.
            proceedings suspended 
            
            
            I have directed the District Attorney not to institute proceedings, until he shall receive a different direction, against persons not holding office, who have been relieved by Act of Congress, under the circumstances referred to in your letter.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
