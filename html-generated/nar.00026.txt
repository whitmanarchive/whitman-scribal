Will you be good enough, at your earliest convenience, to report the facts upon which the seizure has been made, and such opinion thereon as you may entertain, in order that I may answer the query of the Secretary of State understandingly as to the Expediency of complying with the minster's request?
            Very respectfully your obd't serv't
James Speed
Attorney General.
