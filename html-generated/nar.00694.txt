            Hon. Hugh McCulloch,
            Secretary of the Treasury
            Sir:
            The Clerk of the Supreme Court has informed me that the records in two cases of Flanders, Treasury Agent, v. Tweed, have been received at his office, and desires to know whether I will appear for the Treasury Agent, as in a case in which the United States is concerned. I know nothing about these cases, and desire, therefore, to know whether you are advised of their character so as to be able to say whether they are cases in which the Attorney General of the United States should appear for the Treasury Agent. An early answer is requested.
            Very respectfully,
            your obd't serv't
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General
