            J. H. H. Woodward, Esq.
            Louisville, Ky.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 1st instant, I have to say that the rules of the office do not permit me to give opinions upon the legal questions which you present. For advice as to the mode of proceeding, in the event that you are satisfied that a crime against the United States has been committed in Kentucky, I refer you to the U.S. Attorney for that District.
            It was my supposition from your previous communication that the offences which you alleged were perpetuated in the District of Columbia, and accordingly I sent the papers to the District Attorney here, for examination and action—if the facts should require action.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            case in Ky.
