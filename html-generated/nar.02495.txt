            Messrs. Carlisle &amp; McPherson,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the case of Sheldon W.
                Wright vs. The United States, appealed from the Court of
                Claims, and now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States.
            This case has been held under advisement by the Attorney General, and in his absence
                I do not feel authorized to make any disposition of it. A report upon the case has
                been made by the officer of the Department in charge of such cases, and I have no
                doubt that upon the return of the Attorney General early direction will be given in
                the matter.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            and Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            Sup. Court case
