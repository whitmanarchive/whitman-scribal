            Hon. J. S. Fowler,
            Senate United States,
            Sir:
            I have the honor to inform you, in relation to the prosecution said to be pending against J. S. Carlile, in the United States Court of the Eastern Dist. of Tennessee, that I have directed the District Attorney to report early and in full upon the basis of the letter of Tomlinson Fert, Esq. filed by you, of which he is furnished with a copy—and in the meantime to stay all proceeding in the premises until he shall receive further instructions.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            OH Browning,O. H. Browning
            Attorney General ad interim
