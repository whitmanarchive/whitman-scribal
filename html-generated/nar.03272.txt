            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            Your communication of July 1, 1871, in relation to the claim of Wm. Kiskadden for compensation for the service of teams employed by the United States, and the papers enclosed therein, have received a careful consideration in this Department—and the conclusion is that in view of the weight which the law attaches to doubts of criminal intent in such cases, and the possibility that fraud was not intended, it is not worth while to institute criminal proceedings, unless further discoveries should demonstrate the criminality of the party. I am convinced, however, that the claim should not be paid, in the present state of the proof.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            The papers are returned herewith.
            Wm Kiskadden; claim.
