            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2d instant, enclosing therein a copy of a communication from Mark Edwards, Esq., Disbursing officer of claims of the Bureau of the Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, relative to the refusal of the U.S. Attorney
            certain case of U.S. Att'y at Memphis Tenn
            
            
            
            at Memphis, to indict certain parties for violating the 13th Sec. of the Act of July 4, 1864, in defrauding ex-soldiers of their bounty-money; and asking that this Department direct the Attorney to bring such indictments.
            I reply, I have the honor to inform you that the U.S. Attorney has this day been written to upon the subject as to his action in the premises.
            When he shall have been heard from, I will address you further upon the subject.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
