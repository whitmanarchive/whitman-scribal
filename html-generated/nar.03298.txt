            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            Referring to your letter to me of the 19th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the British Minister, relative to the case of John Davidson,
            p 179
            John Davidson
                        Mont.

            
            
            convicted in Montana Territory of selling whisky to Indians, I have the honor to transmit herewith the copy of a Report of Cornelius Hedges Esq. U.S. District Attorney, of a letter to Mr. Hedges from Wm F. Wheeler, Esq. U.S. Marshal, and of a deposition ofHand, a deputy U.S. Marshal.
            These papers show, I think, that Davidson had a fair trial, and was properly convicted, and that he has no proper claim to the character of a British subject.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
