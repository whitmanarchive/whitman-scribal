            Hon. John W. Johnston,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 9th instant, requesting a copy of the last account rendered by A. S. Gray, Marshal of the Western District of Virginia, I have the honor to say that such accounts do not remain on file in this office, but are immediately upon the receipt here transmitted to the First Auditor of the Treasury, by whom they are sent to the First Comptroller, in whose office they remain on file—and there, I have no doubt, you can obtain the copy which you desire.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            relating to certain copy.
