            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Surveyor of Customs at Cincinnati, wherein he requests that the District Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio may be authorized to defend a suit brought by the Pomeroy Salt Transportation Company, for the recovery of tonnage tax, and other dues.
            In reply, I have the honor to inform you that the Attorney of the U.S. for that District has been directed to take such steps as may be necessary, touching the defence of this suit against the Surveyor of the Customs at Cincinnati.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            defend Surveyor of Customs
            Ohio.
