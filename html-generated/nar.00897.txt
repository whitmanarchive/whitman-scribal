            John T. Croxton, Esq.
            Counsellor at law,
            Washington.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of 28th ult. inquiring what disposition has been made of the Macon Armory case, and if any order has been issued to have the proceedings therein dismissed, whether the same is intended to apply to the entire property involved, consisting of lands and improvements, I have to enclose herewith a copy of a circular letter of instructions addressed to
            
            
            
            the U. S. Attorney for the District of Georgia, by my predecessor, directing him to dismiss all suits and proceedings pending and undetermined in that District under the several Confiscation acts of August 6, 1861, and July 17, 1862.
            If the proceeding or proceedings against the land and improvements referred, is or are pending and undetermined, under the Acts mentioned, I see no reason to doubt that they are embraced by the instructions of my predecessor.
            Very resp. yours,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General
