            Hon. C. Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            Referring to your letter to this Department of the 29th of March last, on the subject of an appearance by the District Attorney before the Surveyor General in investigations
            
            
            
            
            
            touching the swamp and overflowed lands in California, I have the honor to enclose an account of Mr. Latimer, the District Attorney, for $515, as compensation for the service rendered—and to request information on these points:
            First—Was the investigation of so important a character, and affecting interests of such magnitude, as to make the charge for compensation reasonable?
            Second—Has the investigation reached such a stage that the service of the District Attorney in the matter is probably at an end?
            I will thank you to return the account, with your answer.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            acc't Cal.
