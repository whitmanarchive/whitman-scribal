            Hon. Powell Clayton
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            In answer to yours of this
            
                no complaints, &amp;c.
            
            
            
            date, I have the honor to say that upon examination, no complaints are found on file in this Department of a political or official nature against Isaac C. Mills, formerly Marshal for the Eastern District of Arkansas, from the date of his appointment in 1868 to his removal in 1870.
            I have at your request sent to Senator Trumbull, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, all papers now on file relating to his removal.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
