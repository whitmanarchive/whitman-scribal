            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, and of the accompanying papers, relating to the failure of one E. O. D. Stucker to comply with the terms of his contract made by and
            case of Stucken
            W. Texas
            
            
            
            between him and the Quartmeraster's Department for furnishing and delivering corn at Fort Concho, Texas.
            I have caused the papers to be transmitted to the Attorney of the U.S. for the Western District of Texas, with instructions to institute such legal proceedings against the defaulting party in this case as are warranted by the facts in the matter.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
