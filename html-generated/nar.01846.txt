            Gents:
            In a letter from this office dated October 10, 1870, you were furnished with lists of Books, (State Reports,) needed for our Library, and requested to furnish the same. Some of the books mentioned in the lists were subsequently received from you, but there still remains a number of them unsupplied. We shall be glad to obtain as many of the latter as you can furnish up to the 1st of June next, from and after which date the order will be considered revoked.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
