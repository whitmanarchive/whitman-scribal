            Hon. Wm H. Seward,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I beg leave to enclose a determination and order respecting the claim of Nott &amp; Company, American merchants trading and doing business in China, against the Chinese gov't, for losses of coin sustained in 1857, by the capture and robbery of the vessel called the Neva,— which I have this day signed in duplicate; and I have delivered one of the same to the claimant authorized to receive the payment,— &amp; the other I herewith transmit to you.
I have the honor to be,
            &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
            Wm. M. Evarts.
            Attorney Gen'l.
