            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst. enclosing a request of the Agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, at Huntsville, Ala. that legal assistance be given to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama in certain prosecutions before the U.S. Court.
            The subject of assistance to the District Attorney has been for some weeks the subject of correspondence between this Department and that officer.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            No. Ala.
