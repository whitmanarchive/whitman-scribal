            Messrs. George R. and Samuel Fairbanks,
            University Place, Franklin Co. Tennessee
            Washington, D. C.
            Gentlemen:
            A copy of your letter of the 21st September last was sent to the District Attorney at St. Augustine, Fla., with instructions of the same date, to report. I herewith enclose a copy of the reply of that officer, and have to communicate for your information, by direction of the Attorney General, that under the facts, as developed in these papers, the proper course for you to pursue is to apply to the court in regular form for the opening of the decree which has been made in the premises. It will then be in regular order for you to plead your pardon in court, and await a regular adjudication. This is the method of relief prescribed by the laws of the country. I also enclose a copy of our instructions of this date to the District Attorney.
            Respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Att'y. Gen'l.
            [Copies Enc.]
