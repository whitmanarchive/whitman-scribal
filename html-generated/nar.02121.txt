            U. S. Attorney,
            Galveston, Texas.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the indictment of Chester F. Linkfield, Esq. in the District Court of your District.
            C. F. Linkfield Texas.
            
            
            Your Report upon the subject is perfectly satisfactory to the Department.
            I have written to Mr. Carroll at Rome, New York, who has interceded in behalf of said Linkfield, and has asked that the case be dismissed, that Linkfield will be required to appear and answer to the indictment in his case when called in its regular turn at the December term of the Court.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            and Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            
            see Let B'k I 115
