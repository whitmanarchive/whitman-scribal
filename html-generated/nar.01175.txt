            Hon. Caleb Cushing,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            In No. 179. of the Supreme Court of the United States, Wm. N. McVeigh, pl'ff. in error, vs. The United States—the writ of error from the Supreme Court is dated the second day of December, 1868, and made returnable on the third Monday of December next. I propose to move, to-morrow, (Friday,) in Court, that the writ of error be dismissed because not made returnable on the third Monday in December 1868.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Motion in U. S. Sup. Court
