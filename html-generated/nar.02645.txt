            Dec. 5, 1871.
            Hon. James B. McKean,
            Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
            Salt Lake City, Utah.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 27th ultimo addressed to the Acting Attorney General has been received.
            In reply I have to say that I am not advised whether the appointment of Mr. Bates removes the desirableness
            Utah question
            
            
            
            of a special assistant to the District Attorney for Utah in the prosecutions (of peculiar interest now,) arising there. If Mr. Bates is satisfied that such assistance is necessary, this Department will authorize it, if the funds at its command will permit. Of course, I should very much respect the choice of Mr. Bates in such a matter; though it occurs to me that if special assistance be required, that of Mr. Baskin would be more valuable, and could be obtained with less expense to the Government than that of any other person.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
