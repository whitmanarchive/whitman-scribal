            Hon. W. Mungen,
            Findlay, Ohio.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., in which you ask me two questions relating to the Revenue laws of the U. S. I have no right to give you my opinion upon these questions. In any case before a Court, involving them, the Judge must decide, so far as that case is concerned,—and in the administration of the law, the Dept. of the Treasury establishes the rule it will follow; and it is my duty to give an opinion only when requested by the President, or the head of a Department.
            Very Resp, yourt obd't serv't,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
