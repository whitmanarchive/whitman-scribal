            To Mr. John Brown,

            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 12th inst. relative to the discharge of Hospital Steward Francis M. Cleaver from the U. S. Army, - and to say that the same has been referred to the Secretary of War, who alone can act in the premises.
            Very respectfully,
            Wm. Stewart,
            Chief Clerk.
