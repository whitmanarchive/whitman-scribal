            Hon. O. H. Browning,
            Attorney General ad interim
            Sir:
            I have the honor to lay before you a Report addressed to you by the Law Clerk, covering communications from the Solicitor of the Treasury from his subordinate, the chief of the secret service division—and other papers, together with a memorandum of my personal recollection of certain facts,—the whole relating to alleged irregulations of a gentleman connected with this office, in connection with a 
            
            
            recommendation for the pardon of a certain convict; and also, I lay before you the papers in the pardon case.
            I beg to make known to you that the necessity of this investigation has greatly impeded the regular order of the pardon business of this office, which should be relieved as early as practicable.
            I cannot forbear to add an expression of good will and profound sympathy for the person whose conduct is the subject of these papers, and of the great regret I would feel should it become necessary to treat him with severity.
            Very Respectfully, your obedient serv't,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
