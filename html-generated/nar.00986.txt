            Gentlemen:
            In reply to your letter of the 9th inst. I have to say that the Attorney General will take Hoffman's Land Cases of Cal., and Idaho Reports, at the prices stated.
            Your letter "of some days since, relative to books now on hand as a portion of your (our) unfilled order," has failed to reach the office.
            Very Respectfully,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
            Library books.
