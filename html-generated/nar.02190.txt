            G. Willey Wells, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Holly Springs, Miss.
            Sir:
            You will enter a nolle prosequi in the second indictment in your District against Gilbert J. Ferriss, and direct his immediate liberation from arrest under that indictment. Such was the wish of the President when he granted a pardon in the case which has been tried, but I believe it has not been communicated to you before.
            Very respll'y,
            A. T. Akerman, Att'y Gen'l
            Ferriss' case
            Miss.
