            A. B. Williams, Esq.
            No. 310 4½ street,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I return herewith your account, (left at the Department yesterday,) for services rendered and expenses incurred by you while in the performance of official business under my direction.
            By your appointment,—which was not to continue more than thirty days—you were allowed $300 by way of compensation. It was also understood that your actual expenses incurred while so employed were to be defrayed by this Department also.
            As a detailed statement is in all cases required of the Disbursing Officer of this Department by the Accounting Officers of the Treasury, before passing upon his accounts, I have to suggest, therefore, that you will transmit to this Department, at your earliest convenience, such a statement.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            correct form of acc't
