            Hon. B. F. Wade,
            President of the Senate U. S.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the resolution of the Senate, of February 29, 1868, calling for information in relation to the case of Lucius P. Bryan, sometime under indictment in the United States Court for the District of Connecticut for the offence of robbing the mails.
            In reply to said Resolution, I have the honor to state that, upon a careful investigation of the papers presented to me by Senator Dixon, copies of which are herewith transmitted, I deemed it my duty to direct the United States Attorney to enter a nolle prosequi. No previous inquiry was made of the District Attorney, as the Assistant District Attorney, who had immediate charge of
            
            
                the case, and was personally cognizant of the facts, fully certified to the correctness of the statements upon which the order was made, and recommended a nolle prosequi. I am not advised what course has been taken, under the order, by the District Attorney.
            I have the honor to be, very respectfully
            Your obedient servant,
            Henry Stanbery
            Attorney General.
