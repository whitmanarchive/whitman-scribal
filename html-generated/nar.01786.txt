           Mrs. A. Burton, Grand Hotel,
           San Francisco, Cal.
           Madam:
           I have received your letter of the 4th instant, transmitted by Senator Cole.
           From the representations of your friends, I have a strong personal desire to accommodate you in the matter of the Jamuel Rancho. But other parties adversely interested protest against such a disposition of the case as you desire; and under these circumstances I do not feel at liberty to dismiss the appeal, and thus abandon forever a claim of the United States which many parties suppose to be good, without perfect assurance that your title is utterly unassailable in law. The slight investigation which I have been able to give to the subject has not yet satisfied me that such is the case. Should I become so satisfied, I will dismiss the appeal.
           Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            California case "Jamuel rancho"
