            Hon. J. A. J. Creswell,
            Postmaster General.
            Sir:
            I have received a letter, dated the 5th instant, from C. Cochran, Jr. Esq. Superintendent of Mail Depredations, enclosing a telegram to the Second Assistant Postmaster General, from W. W. Wharton, Esq., Special agent for the P. O. Department, stating that one Wm. G. Monk, formerly Cashier of the New Orleans P. O. now under indictment, charged with embezzling letters, and a fugitive from justice, can be found at the Prescott House, New York city. This telegram is referred to me by Mr. Cochran for such action as the circumstances of the case may warrant.
            
            Case of one Monk, fugitive P. O. swindler from N. O.
            
            
            
            If it is known that said Monk is in the city of New York, Special Agent Wharton should so inform the U.S. Dist. Attorney at New Orleans, and request him to send a copy of the indictment, and of the warrant for the arrest of said Monk, to the U.S. Dist. Attorney at New York, who will have the necessary warrant issued for his arrest and return to New Orleans. The telegram referred is herewith returned. It being an original paper, I presume you will require it for the files of your Department.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
