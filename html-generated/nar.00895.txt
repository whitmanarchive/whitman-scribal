            Hon. T. Lyle Dickey,
            Assistant Attorney Gen.
            Sir:
            I enclose a copy of a letter just rec'd at this office from Mr. John A. Wills, of counsel in a case before the Court of Claims, requesting certain action, &amp;c.—Also a copy of a letter in reference to same case, sent by the Attorney General to counsel mentioned, on the 28th ult.
            I prefer, in the absence of Mr. Hoar, not to issue any direction in the matter, but have thought it might be well to send you copies of these letters, for your information and action.
            Very Resp. yours,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney Gen'l.
