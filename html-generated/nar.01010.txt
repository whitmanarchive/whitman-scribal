            October 1, 1869.
            Hon. J. H. Howe,
            Chief Justice Wyoming Terr.
            Cheyenne.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your letter of the 24th ult, asking for a leave of absence from the Territory.
            While fully appreciating the manner of your discharge of your official duties, and your claim to any reasonable and customary relief from them, I have to say that it is not usual to give the consent of this Department to
            On leave of absence. 
            
            
            
            an indefinite period of absence, and you do not name any specific time for which you wish it. Your return to Illinois for the purpose of settling your private business would meet my entire approval, and I can see no objection to your coming to Washington, if it can be included within the limits of the ordinary leave of absence;—but you will permit me very respectfully to add that it is expected that the Judges in the Territories will reside continuously in them, ready to attend to whatever official duties may present themselves, and that in my judgment attendance on the business of other persons at Washington is not considered as belonging to, or compatible with, the nature and requirements of the office which they have assumed.
            With this suggestion, an application for a leave of absence of a specified length, at such time as will be most convenient to you, will receive the immediate attention of this Department.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            No indefinite leave of absence can be granted.
