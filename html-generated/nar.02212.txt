            Dec. 1, 1871,
            L. D. Latimer, Esq. U.S. Attorney,
            San Francisco, Cal.
            Sir:
            In taking up the case of S. W. Robinson, and Others, vs. The United States, pending in the Supreme Court, on error to the Circuit Court for your District, for the purpose of preparing my brief, I find that no brief has been received from you, as required by instructions heretofore given to District Attorneys by the Attorney General. When you consider the great number and variety of questions that this Department is called on to argue in the Supreme Court, you must perceive the advantage to us of briefs, or other memoranda, from District Attorneys, who argue the cases below. I will thank
            brief &amp;c requested 
            
            
            you to comply with the regulation of the Department in this respect at your earliest convenience.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow,
            Solicitor General.
