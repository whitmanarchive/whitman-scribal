            In view of the fact that Col. William McMichael will succeed Mr. Talbot in the
                office of Assistant Attorney General in charge of the business of the United States
                in the Court of Claims, on the 15th of October next, it is desirable that Mr.
                McMichael should have an opportunity to familiarize himself with the business of the
                office. I will therefore thank you to afford him access to the papers and dockets of
                that office, and also give him such information as he may desire touching the
                business connected therewith.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
           access to papers, &amp;c.
