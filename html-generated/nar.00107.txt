           Sept. 26, 1866,
            To Hon. Gideon Welles,
            Secretary of the Navy.
            Sir:
            I have examined the abstract, &amp; other papers submitted to me relative to the title of "Seavey's Island," in the Piscataqua River, Maine, &amp; am of opinion that the several persons named in the abstract, dated July, 1866, &amp; prepared by Francis Bacon, Esq. have, and are competent to convey, good &amp; valid titles to the respective lots or parcels of land on said island, claimed as owned by them, and delineated on the plan accompanying said abstract (marked B.)—all of which said lots compose the whole territory included in said island.
            I have the honor to remain,
            Your ob'dt serv't,
            Henry Stanbery
            Attorney General.
