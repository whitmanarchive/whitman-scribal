            Oct. 3, 1871.
            His Excellency George L. Woods,
            Governor,
            Salt Lake City, Utah T.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant,
                relative to the appointment of Col. Wickizer to the office of Attorney of the U. S.
                for Utah, and requesting that the Attorney General secure the consent of the
                Postmaster General to Col. Wickizer holding the office of postal agent in connection
                with that of U. S. Attorney.
            I fully concur in the opinion of the Postmaster General that Col. Wickizer should
                not hold both offices—and it was expected by this Department when he was
                appointed Attorney of the U. S. for your Territory, that he would resign the position
                of postal agent then held by him.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            Col. Wickizer, Utah, cannot hold
            two offices of U. S.
          410
