            Hon. Gideon Welles,
            Secretary of the Navy.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith
            the papers enclosed in your letter of the 14th
            of June last, relative to a tract of land
            proposed to be conveyed to the United States
            by the Visitors and Governors of St. John's
            College, Md.; the information which they
            furnish being too meagre to enable the
            Attorney General to pass upon the validity
            of the title to the premises.
            As a guide in collecting the
            evidence desired for this purpose, I transmit
            a copy of our standing Regulations.
            I am, Sir,
            Very Respectfully,
            John M. Binkley
            Acting Attorney Gen'l.
