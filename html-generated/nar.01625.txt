            Hon. Columbus Delano,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I enclose a note from James P. Tustin, Esq., requesting a direction to the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, for the return of certain papers to the Pension Bureau.
            Will you do me the favor to ascertain from the Commissioner of Pensions whether such a direction would be proper in this case?
            Please return Mr. Tustin's letter.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain pension papers
