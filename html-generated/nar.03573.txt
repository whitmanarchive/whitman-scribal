            Hon. M. H. Carpenter,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I am not aware of any intention to move to advance the case of the barque "Mary Merritt."
            If it should become proper to make such a motion while I am in office, I will see that you have notice.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            "Mary Merritt" case
