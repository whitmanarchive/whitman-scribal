            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit herewith a letter from J. W. Purviance, Esq. U. S. Attorney for the Western Dist. of Tennessee, dated the 1st inst., in relation to a suit against Gen. R. E. Clary, U. S.A., for acts done in performance of his public duties.
            In view of this, and other cases recently referred to this office, I desire to suggest that when it is desired that the Attorney General should take charge of the defence of similar suits against officers of the Army, he should be promptly notified of the commencement
                
                suits ag't Gen Clary Tenn.
            
            
            of the action, as it may be impossible to defend them after judgment has been obtained.
            I will thank you to return Mr. Purviance's letter, after perusal.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't serv't,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
