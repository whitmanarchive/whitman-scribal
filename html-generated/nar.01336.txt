            Sir:
            The Attorney General directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, relative to costs in the case of U. S. appellants, vs. Hosmer—and to say that he has referred it to Assistant Attorney General Talbot, whose office is at the Court of Claims.
            Very respectfully yours
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
            letter ack.
