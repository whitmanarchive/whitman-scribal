            Enoch Totten, Esq.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 27th ult. enclosing the account of C. K. Davis, Esq. U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, for compensation in the matter of the canal at Duluth, has been received.
            This claim has been made the subject of a letter from this Department to Mr. Davis.
            I am not yet advised that his services in the matter are certainly at an end—and I have made inquiry of him on that subject. At the termination of his services, I intend that he shall be promptly paid.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            bill of C. K. Davis
