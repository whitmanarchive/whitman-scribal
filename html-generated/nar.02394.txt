            Mr. Walter L. Hill:
            Dear Sir:
            I have information that you have of late been often absent
                
            
            
            from the office, and that, when present, you have not always been in a condition to do duty. After my distinct personal announcement to you that such delinquencies must not be repeated, this conduct obliges one to terminate your connection with the Department of Justice. I have foreborne to take this step until the present moment, in the hope that your course would enable me to gratify my strong personal wishes of your continuance in the Department. But justice to the Government forbids any further toleration of such irregularities.
            I am, very respectfully yours,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
