            Sir:
            Referring to the letter of this Department addressed to you under date of the 23d of August last, enclosing a communication from the Attorney of the U.S. for New Mexico, to the Solicitor of the Treasury, relative to the case of William Knorr, and charging that certain military officers of the U.S. had been guilty of improper conduct in relation to said trial, I have the honor to enclose herewith, for such action as to you may seem proper in the premises, another letter upon the subject from the Attorney of the U.S. for New Mexico to the Solicitor of the Treasury.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
