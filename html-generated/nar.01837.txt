      T. J. Durant, Esq.
      Washington, D.C.
      Sir:
      I have received yours of the 20th instant, suggesting that compensation may be due to the
        estate of the late Edmund Randolph, for professional services in the case of Castillero, vs. The United States.
      I have caused examination to be made, of the correspondence on file in this office, and
        cannot discover that Mr. Randolph was ever claim of estate of E. Randolph
         retained by the Attorney
        General. If it can be shown to me that he was so employed, and was never compensated, the
        claim shall receive consideration. But as at present advised, I am not authorized to pay
        it.
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
