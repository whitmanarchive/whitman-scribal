            Nov. 4, 1871,
            H. E. Hudson, Esq. U. S. Attorney,
            Memphis, Tenn.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Mark Edwards, the Disbursing Officer of Claims 
                
            140
           
            
           of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, at Memphis; also a copy of a letter to the Department from the Secretary of War, of the 2d  inst. relative to your alleged refusal to bring indictments against parties violating the 13th Section of the Act of July 4, 1864, in defrauding the ex-soldiers of their bounty money—and requesting that you be instructed to bring such indictments.
            From what I can learn from these letters, I am unable at present to give any instructions in the premises. I therefore desire that you will at your earliest convenience report to this Department the cause and the grounds upon which you decline to indict parties under said law.  In making this request I wish you to understand that the Department finds no fault with your action in the matter, but wishes to learn your views before taking action upon the request of the Secretary.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
