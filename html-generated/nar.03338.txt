            Thomas H. Talbot, Esq,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            Sir:
            After consideration of the case of Rebecca A. G. Minor, Executrix of William J. Minor, deceased, which is the subject of your letter of the 22d ultimo, I think that it is not worth while to take or prosecute an appeal therein.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            stop appeal
