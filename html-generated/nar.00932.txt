           May 18, 1869.
            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to send enclosed herewith a copy of a letter this day received by me from the U. S. Attorney for the Southern Dist. of New York, relating to the steamers "Memphis" and "Santiago de Cuba." The several Dist. Attorneys are instructed that whenever sufficient evidence is made known to them to establish before a Court of Justice probable cause to believe that any vessel is forfeitable for a violation of the Neutrality laws, they are to file a libel, and arrest the vessel. The expediency of your informing the Minister of Spain that the U. S. Attorneys of the several Districts will receive directly from the Spanish consuls any facts they may be pleased to communicate, respecting any violation of the Neutrality laws of the U. S., is submitted to your consideration.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
