            I have received your letter of the 12th instant, and have made the President acquainted with its contents. No such Committee as you refer to has presented itself here, and should such efforts as you apprehend be made, the representations in your letter will be borne in mind.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            letter &amp;c. acknowledged.
