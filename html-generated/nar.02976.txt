            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing two
             
            
                
                accounts of the Penitentiary at Albany, New York, for keeping convicts during the last half of the year 1870, sentenced by Military Court Marshal—and in reply inform you that the charge made on both accounts for keeping these convicts was included by the Superintendent of the Penitentiary in the accounts for keeping convicts transferred from the District of Columbia, and paid by this Department.
            The papers transmitted with your letter are herewith returned.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                
            certain bills from New York Penitentiary
