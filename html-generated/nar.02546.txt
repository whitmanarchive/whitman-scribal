            Raleigh, N. C.
            Dear Sir:
            On my return to Washington I find your letter of the 18th ultimo. I do not see how Mr. Merrimon can be paid under existing laws, unless it shall appear that Mr. Starbuck employed him by direction of the Attorney General, or by the Head, or other authorized officer of some one of the Departments. If such authority were given, I presume the Department which authorized the employment will feel bound to pay for the same.
            When informed upon this point, I can advise you more confidently than at present.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Cannot legally pay.
