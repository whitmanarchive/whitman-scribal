            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I transmit for your information a copy of a letter described by the writer as unofficial,
            
            letter
            
            
            
            from C. W. C. Rowell, Esq., U.S. District Attorney for Arizona.
            I am unable to say how much consideration is due to his suggestions. But it is just to him to declare that, according to all my information, he is a zealous and faithful officer.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
