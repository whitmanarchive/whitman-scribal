            J. D. Smith, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Montgomery, Ala.
            Sir:
            You are hereby instructed to dismiss the proceedings in confiscation instituted in the Dist. Court of U. S. for the Middle Dist. of Ala. against certain property situated in Bibb Co. Ala. &amp; known as the Bibb Co. Iron Works, claimed by Francis S. Lyon,—the same having been sold to him by Gen. Swayne of the Freedmen's Bureau;— unless Mr. Lyon should prefer that, for the purpose of securing &amp; perfecting the title, he should desire them to be continued for his own use &amp; benefit; &amp; in that case the proceedings will be carried on in the name of the U. S. at the costs &amp; charges of Mr. Lyon.
            In case of such dismissal it will be made without costs to Mr. Lyon.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Ass't. Att'y Gen'l.
