            Hon. Orange Ferriss,
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 17th inst. to Gen. Pleasonton, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, has been referred by him to this office.
            I will write to the Marshal of the Northern District of New York, informing him of your suggestion that a Deputy at Glen's Falls could justly be appointed.
            This Office has no control over the appointment of U. S. Commissioners. Such appointments are made by the Circuit Courts.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            appt'm't of U. S. Deputy Marshal at Glen's Falls, N. Y.
