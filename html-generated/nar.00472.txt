            Hon. Benjamin F. Wade,
            President of the Senate.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a Report which has been made to me by the Chief Clerk of this Office, in which my attention is called to the inexpediency of diminishing the appropriations heretofore allowed for the business with which the Attorney General is charged by law. It is proper to add that the professional labor of this office is at present beyond the means at command. It is deemed pertinent to submit this matter to your consideration.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            O. H. Browning,
            Attorney General ad interim.
            [copy enc.]
