            To
            Jacob P. Leese, Esq.
            Sir:
            I have to-day received yours of the 27th. tendering your resignation of the office of U. S. Marshal for California, to which you were recently appointed by the President.
            I have now to say that your resignation is accepted,—&amp; I feel bound to add that my confidence in your integrity &amp; ability to discharge the duties of the office remains unshaken—&amp; that I regret the untoward circumstances which have constrained you to resign, &amp; which induce me to accept the resignation.
            Very respectfully &amp;c
            Henry Stanbery.
