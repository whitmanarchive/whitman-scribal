            The President.
            Sir:
            In reply to the Resolution of the Senate, adopted January 30th, 1868, requesting to be informed— "how many Justices of the Peace are now in commission in each Ward respectively of the City of Washington"—referred to this office for Report, I have the honor to transmit the enclosed list. It is proper to say that some of these Officers do but a limited business. This list does not include the names of several clerks holding commissions as Justices of the Peace, but acting only for the convenience of the various public offices to which they are attached.— Those marked, (M. P.) are Metropolitan Police Magistrates.
            I am, Sir, with great respect,
            Henry Stanbery
            Attorney General.
            [List enclosed with above.]
