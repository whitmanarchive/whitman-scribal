            W. H. Miller, Esq.
            Attorney at Law,
            Cheyenne, Wyoming Terr.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, transmitting the certificate of Judge Howe that you had been assigned by him as counsel for a prisoner on trial before him—and to say to you that such services are not customarily paid by this Department, there being no appropriation under its control, out of which such payment can be made.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Ch. Clerk.
            certain acct ag't U. S.
            Wyoming.
