            Hon. Wm. H. Wisener,
            Shelbyville, Tenn.
            Dear sir:
            I have received yours of the 26th ult., respecting the appointment of an Assistant to the District Attorney.
            I am aware of the importance of the prosecutions in Tennessee under the Enforcement Act, for I suppose that nowhere in the country is there a stronger determination than in Tennessee to disregard, and, if possible, to annul, for all practical purposes, Article XIV, of the Amendments to the Constitution.—I shall be very much disappointed if this effort shall finally succeed. But I hesitate to employ associate counsel to the District Attorney in the present state of the funds at the command of this office, especially in view of the disposition shown in the last Congress to curtail the employment of such counsel.
            As a general rule, the regular professional and official representatives of the United States ought to be equal to all the exigencies of the public service in their respective branches. Should it appear, however, that such extraordinary employment is necessary in Tennessee, your recommendation of Mr. Shackelford will be most respectfully considered.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            question of special counsel in Tenn. for U. S. Att'y.
