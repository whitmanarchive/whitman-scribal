            October 13, 1869.
            Gen. W. T. Sherman,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the papers inclosed in your letter of the 9th inst., relating to the claim of P. B. Cook, for rent of land at the mouth of Genessee river, New York. An opinion on this case was rendered by Mr. Attorney Gen'l Cushing, July 7th, 1855, and will be found in
            old claim of P. B. Cook (War Dep't)
            
            
            the 7th Vol. of the printed Opinions, page 320.
            I also enclose a letter dated September 29, 1855, from Bv't Colonel W. Trumbull, to Colonel J. J. Abert, Chief of Topographical Engineers, from which it appears that this Opinion, with all the papers, was placed in the hands of the U. S. Attorney for the Northern Dist. of New York.
            The records of this Office furnish no further information in regard to the case.
            Very respectfully yours,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
