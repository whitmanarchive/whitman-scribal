            Nov. 7, 1871.
            Hon. John S. Watts,
            Santa Fé, New Mex.
            Sir:
          I have received your letter of Oct. 5th, in relation to the time of arguing the Vigil case. I telegraphed you last Thursday that the case would probably be reached by the 15th inst. Since then, application has been made
              Vigil case
          
          by Gen. Ewing for a continuance for the present term, on the ground that he is unprepared, by reason of the recent sickness and death of his father.
            I have agreed to the continuance, and shall inform you by telegram to-day. But after this continuance, I feel unable to agree to any further accommodation to counsel on the other side, and expect to press the case to an argument whenever it shall be reached on the docket of the next December term.
            Very resp'lly,
            A. T. Akerman,
         Attorney General.
