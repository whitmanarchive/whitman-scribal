           December 26, 1867.
            Messrs Stanton, Wood, &amp; Bell,
            Counsellors at Law
            P. O. box 3763,
            New York City.
            Gentlemen:
            With his letter of the 26th ultimo, in which he decided not to interfere in the case of John C. Braine the Attorney General enclosed all the evidence which had been submitted to him in the premises, to the District Attorney. In a subsequent letter of the 30th ultimo. addressed to Messrs. Levin &amp; Ham, 73 Nassau street, a copy of this decision was enclosed, with information that the representations made by those gentlemen had not sufficed to change his impressions of duty. You now inform the Attorney General that the Commission of Braine has been found and that it has become, since that decision, an indisputable fact that Braine was a Confederate officer when he captured the "Chesapeake"; and you inquire, with this additional evidence, whether the Attorney General can recommend Braine's as a proper case for the amnesty oath.
            I am instructed to say that the Attorney General is not prepared to determine such a point without the original evidence, with the Report, and the remarks of the District Attorney.
            Respectfully yours,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            
            for Braine's case see Let Book F pp 483, 569, 584
            see Ins. Book A, p. 131.
