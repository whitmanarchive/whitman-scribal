            Hon. Moses Hallett, Chief Justice,
            Denver, Colorado Terr.
            Sir:
            Your request for a leave of absence did not receive an immediate answer because I knew that the President intended to issue an order upon the subject of leaves of absence. He has done so, and a copy of the order has been sent to you.
            Your application not showing reasons for absence of the urgent character which the order requires, I do not feel at liberty to grant it.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            declining leave
