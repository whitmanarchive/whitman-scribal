            D.W. Middleton, Esq.
            Clerk of the Supreme Court United States
            Sir:
            I am in receipt of your letter of the 20th inst. relative to the cases of Flanders, v. Tweed, and I have requested the Secretary of the Treasury to advise me whether these are cases in which the Attorney General should appear for the Treasury Agent.— I will advise you of his answer.
                
                In the meantime I return the letter of Mr. Whitaker, which you enclosed.
            Very Respectfully, &amp;c.
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
