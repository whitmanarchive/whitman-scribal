            Assistant Attorney General's office, Court of Claims.
            Sir:
            As, in consequence of Mr. Talbot's resignation, Mr. Hill and I will have to argue the Court of Claims cases now pending in the Supreme Court, I will be obliged to you if you will meet us at Mr. Hill's office on Friday at 12 o'clock to go over the docket with us, and give us what information you can respecting the cases on it. Will you also at that time be good enough to bring copies of the records, and of such briefs as are prepared?
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney Genl.
