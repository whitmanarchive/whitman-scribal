            Hon. Noah Davis,
            U. S. Attorney,
            New York.
            Sir:
            In the matter of the supposed complicity of Polhaimus &amp; Jackson in the frauds of J. Ledyard Hodge, which has been the subject of direction from this Department, you will prefer a bill or bills, and lay the evidence which you have or can obtain against those parties, and any others who may appear to be implicated, before the Grand Jury as soon as possible. It is due to public justice that there should be a thorough investigation of this matter, and a vigorous prosecution of all guilty persons.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Polhaimus &amp; Jackson, N. Y.
