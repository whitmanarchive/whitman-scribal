            Hon. W. A. Richardson,
            Acting Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of this date, with papers enclosed, all relating to a libel of information against the steamer Matilda arising under the Internal Revenue laws. The claimant proposes that on the payment of $50 as a penalty and the costs of suit, the libel be dismissed, and the steamer be restored him. I recommend that this compromise of the suit be made.
            The papers are returned.
            I remain, yours very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
