            John Jay, Esq.
            President Union League Club,
            26th street &amp; Madison av.
            New York City.
            Dear Sir:
            The record in the Rosenberg case was not printed until Monday last. On that day, I moved the court to advance it for argument, &amp; named the first Tuesday in February as the earliest day that my previous engagments in court would permit of my attention to the argument, and as being probably as early a day as
            
            
            
            I could expect the attendance of the opposing counsel. If it is the intention of persons interested in the prosecution to furnish to me a complete brief in the cause, or the attendance of Associate counsel, I shall be obliged by your providing me with the brief, &amp; putting me in communication with the associate counsel as soon as possible.
            No entry has been made on the docket, of any counsel for the defendant, in the case, and I am not advised to whom I should communicate with respecting this assignment of the cause, or its future argument. As no publication of the assignment of the cause has been made in the newspapers, so as to attract the attention of opposing counsel, you will be so good as to see that notice is given to such counsel, and that I am advised at once whether they will be prepared to attend on the day assigned.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient serv't,
            Wm M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
