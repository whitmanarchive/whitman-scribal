           Hon. Hamilton Fish,
           Secretary of State.
           Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of Mr. Davis, Acting Secretary of State, of July 27th instant, notifying me of a complaint by the Chargé d'Affaires of Prussia, respecting the conduct of the U. S. Commissioner at New Orleans. This Department has no control over the U. S. Commissioners; but I will examine the case, and will instruct the District Attorney at New Orleans to make such representations to the Commissioner, or to the District Judge, as the circumstances seem to require.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Complaint of Prussian Chargé.
            See, Ins. Book A. pp. 380, 384.
