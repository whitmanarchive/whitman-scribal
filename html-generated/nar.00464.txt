            Hon. H. J. Anderson,
            Auditor for the Post Office Department.
            Sir:
            I enclose an extract from a letter addressed to the President by Dr. S. J. Wheeler, of Windsor, N. C., under date of 4th January last, in which he asks relief against a judgment which is said to have passed against him for some default or delinquency in relation to funds of the government in his hands as postmaster at the outbreak of the Rebellion. From his representation of the matter, it is probable that the President would think it worthy inquiry whether the default was not merely a technical one, and whether, if so, any method is available for the relief of the party from the hardship.
            I have therefore to ask from your office such an abstract of the record as may afford the President a competent knowledge of the case.
            Respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
