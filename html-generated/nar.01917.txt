            Hon. Wm. A Richardson,
            Acting Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of this date, with the accompanying papers, all relating to the case of William S. Grimes, of Kentucky, arising under the Internal Revenue Laws.
            I recommend that it be compromised on the terms proposed, namely, on payment of the $10 as tax, and $50, as specific penalty.
            Very Respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
