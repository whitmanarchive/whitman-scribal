            Hon. L. J. Gartrell,
            Atlanta, Geo.
            Sir:
            I am advised by the Postmaster General that he knows of no reason for not enforcing the law in the civil and criminal cases against Thomas G. Simms in the Northern District of Georgia. I therefore do not feel at liberty to authorize any further delay in those cases.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            T. G. Simms' case Geo.
            see Ins. B'k. B. p. 65.
