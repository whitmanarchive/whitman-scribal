            Nov. 10, 1871.
            Mrs. Caroline L. Miller,
            Charleston, S. C.
            Madam: 
            I have received yours of the 29th ultimo, forwarded from Yorkville. While you have my warmest sympathy, I do not feel that it would be proper official action for me to arrest the prosecution against your son. I cannot suppose that he will be convicted in New York, unless he shall be proved to be guilty, and in that case I know no reason why he should not suffer the penalty.
          Hoping for your sake, as well as his own, that the investigation will show him to be innocent,
              Case of Miller
              I am, yours respectfully,
             A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
