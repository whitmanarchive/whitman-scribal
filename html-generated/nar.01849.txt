            Wm. Henry Anthon, Esq.
            No. 16, Exchange Place,
            New York City.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the 1st instant, in relation to the case of Richard Baker Caldwell.
            I am advised of no good reason for sparing him from trial upon any of the indictments against him. The application which you make for his release from all the indictments
            
                case of R. B. Caldwell
            
            
                
            but one, does not rest upon any merits in the cases themselves, but on the supposed fact that he was arrested in the wrong place. I do not consider this fact, if made out, sufficient to authorize the granting of the application.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
