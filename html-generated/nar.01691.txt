           Feb. 6, 1871.
            Hon. Lyman Trumbull,
            Chairman Judiciary Committee,
            U. S. Senate.
            Sir:
            I have received a letter addressed to this Department, under date of the 3d instant, by the Clerk of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, stating that he had been
            
            
            directed by the Committee to request me to inform them "what was the entire compensation and fees of the U. S. District Attorney for the District of Louisiana, for the last fiscal year, giving the amount of each quarter separately."
            I have the honor to inform your honorable Committee that upon an examination of the records of this Department, it appears that no returns of the fees and emoluments of the Attorney of the United States for Louisiana were made during the period from July 1st, 1869, to April 22d, 1870,—and that nothing was paid to him from the Treasury during that time. The only return rendered during the fiscal year was by the late Attorney, Mr. A. B. Long, from April 23d to June 30th, from which it appears that his fees and emoluments for that time amounted to $718 33/100.
            It may be proper for me to say, in this connection, that the semi-annual returns required by the Attorneys of the United States do not include the two per centum, and other fees allowed to them by the eleventh and twelfth sections of the Act entitled "An Act to prevent and punish frauds upon the Revenue, to provide for the more certain and speedy collection of claims, in favor of the United States, and for other purposes," approved March
            
            Fees, &amp;c of U. S. Att'y in Louisiana.
            
            
            3d, 1863. (12th Stat. p. 741,) See also second Section of the Act of June 27, 1864, (13 Stat. P. 196.)
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
