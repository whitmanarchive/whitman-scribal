            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 11th inst. requests a copy of a letter from this Department to you advising the settlement of the claim of William H. Goodspeed for compensation for the services of the steamer "Silver Star."
            Search has been made in the records of this Department, both at the principal office, and at the branch having in charge the business of the Court of Claims, and no record of such a letter has been found. Mr. McMichael, Assistant Attorney General advises me that he has reason to believe that his predecessor, Mr. Talbot, wrote a letter suggesting that the claim alluded to be settled by the War Department, but no trace of the letter has thus far been discovered. I will write to Mr. Talbot, the late Ass't. Att'y Gen'l. and endeavor to obtain information on the subject from him.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            missing letter.
