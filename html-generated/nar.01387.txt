           June 20, 1870.
            Hon. J. J. Martin,
            Auditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Department.
            Sir:
            I have received a letter of Amos T. Akerman, Esq., U. S. Attorney for Georgia, addressed to you under date of the 8th inst. with a certificate of the Judge of the District Court of the Southern District of Georgia enclosed, all relating to an additional counsel fee to be paid Mr. Akerman for his services in the trial of the suit of The United States vs. Solomon Cohen, which was an action of debt on a Postmaster's bond. This letter you, upon consultation with the Postmaster General, refer to the Attorney General, with a recommendation that the bill be paid.
            While I have no doubt that the services of Mr. Akerman were reasonably
                
                acc't of A. T. Akerman 
            
            
            worth $250, in addition to the $20 allowed him by the fee bill of 1853, I desire to be informed under what law you think he can be paid out of the Treasury of the United States any larger sum than the fee bill prescribes.
            I suppose the services of Mr. Akerman were rendered while he was United States Attorney. If they were not, he can, of course, be paid a reasonable compensation out of any appropriation made for suits relating to the Post Office Department.
            Very respectfully,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
            The papers referred to this Office are herewith returned.
            (enc.)
