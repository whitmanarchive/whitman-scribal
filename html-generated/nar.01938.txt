            E. W. Andrews, Esq.
            Harper's Ferry, West Va
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of June 25th inst. relating to the suit of Brown, vs. Young, in which you say that, contrary to your expectation, you have now ascertained positively that you can be present at the trial of the suit. If Mr. Blackburn is willing to withdraw from the case without any charge to the United States for his retainer in it, in that event the Attorney General desires that you continue to act as Assistant counsel to Mr. Smith in the preparation and trial of the suit. It is left to you to communicate with Mr. Blackburn in this respect. The Attorney General is unwilling to pay for the services of both yourself and Mr. Blackburn, or to break his engagement to Mr. Blackburn without his consent.
            Please report the result of your communication with Mr. Blackburn to this office.
            Very Respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General
            Counsel in Harper's Ferry ejectment suit —
            See Let. Book H. p. 10.
            See last page p 32 of Index H. Let. Book H.
