            Dec. 16, 1871.
            Hon. Geo. M. Robeson,
            Secretary of the Navy.
            Dear Sir:
            I enclose a letter from Mr. J. S. Bean, a very respectable citizen of Augusta, Georgia, soliciting a naval cadetship for his son, Thomas S. Bean. I suppose there is no opening for the lad; but if there should be any I commend him to your favorable consideration.
            I know something of the family,
            Thos. S. Bean
            Ga.
            
            
            
            and believe that they are well disposed politically—though perhaps not very avowedly, (for prudential reasons;) and that they are intelligent, cultivated, and moral people; originally from the North—but of a residence in Georgia long enough to be identified with that State.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
