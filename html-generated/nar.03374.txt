            Hon. George S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo,—and in compliance with the request therein made, have caused a circular letter to be issued to the District Attorneys, Marshals, and Clerks of the U.S. Courts, relative to a vigorous prosecution of all violations of the Internal Revenue laws. A copy of said circular,
            
            
            
            
            which I trust will accomplish the desired effect, is herewith enclosed.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
