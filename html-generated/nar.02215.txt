            David H. Mason, Esq.
            U.S. Attorney,
            Boston, Mass.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 29th ultimo informing me that the suit of the Merchants' National Bank against the State National Bank of Boston, to recover from the latter the amount of a certified check on which the former delivered to Carter the gold deposited in the sub-treasury in place of that extracted by Hartwell has been compromised, and that the banks have united their strength to press the
            Certain Case in Boston 
            (suit ag't U.S) 
            
            claim against the Government, has been received.
            I thank you for the information, and the matter will receive due attention here.
     Very respectfully,       
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
