            U. S. Attorney,
            New York City.
            Sir:
            By direction of the Attorney General, I enclose you herewith a copy of a letter dated the 2d inst. from Alex S. Diven, Esq. (formerly acting Ass't. Provost Marshal General for the Western Division of New York,) in relation to a suit for alleged false imprisonment, brought against him by one James A. Creed. The Attorney General, at the request of the Secretary of War, desires that you take charge of the defence of said action.
            Very respectfully yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clerk.
