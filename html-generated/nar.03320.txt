            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., inviting my attention to the accompanying papers relative to the claim of H. P. Montgomery against the Quartermaster's Department, for tolls—from which it appears that an attempt has been made to defraud the United States.
            I have sent a copy of your letter, with the papers, to the U.S. District Attorney for Kentucky, with instructions to prosecute the guilty parties, if, after an examination of the case, he is satisfied
            
            fraud of H. P. Montgomery.
            Ky.
            
            
            
            that there is reasonable probability of their conviction.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
