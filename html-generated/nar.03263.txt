            Hon. J. A. J. Creswell,
            Postmaster General.
            Sir:
            On the 30th of January last, you referred to me an account of A. B. Maynard, Esq. U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, for services in the case of The U.S. vs. F. Carlisle and B. J. Davidson. On the 15th of February, 1871, C. Cochrane, Esq., Superintendent of Mail Depredations, sent me another communication on the subject, by your direction.
            Within a few days, I have conferred personally with Mr. Maynard, and have informed him of the obstacle to paying the compensation which he asks. The service was rendered in the regular line of his official duty, and a compensation is proscribed for him in the Act of Congress known as the Fee bill. It is held in this Department that in such cases extra compensation is not allowable.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            case of U.S. vs. Carlisle &amp; Davidson, Mich.
