            Dec. 28, 1871.
            Hon. John A. Bingham,
            Chairman of Judiciary Committee,
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to transmit herewith the following papers:
            First—The copy of a letter to myself from Judge Erskine, U.S. District Judge in Georgia.
            Second—A draft prepared by Judge Erskine, of a bill to take away the Circuit jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Georgia—to create a Circuit Court in said District,—and for other purposes.
            Third—the copy of a statement from the Clerk of the U.S. Courts in the Southern District of Georgia, showing the amount of business in that District.
            Fourth—A similar statement from the Clerk of the Court in the Northern District.
            These papers will explain themselves.
            It is the wish of Judge Erskine that the subject shall be laid before your Committee, and that if his bill is approved it shall be submitted to the House.
            I know that the insufficiency of the judicial force of the United States in Georgia is a subject of great complaint among members of the bar. There is really far more business
            
            proposed changes in U.S. Courts in Georgia.
            
            
            
            of a civil nature alone than one industrious and able Judge, such as we now have, can keep up with—to say nothing of the large amount of criminal business.
            No doubt the Members of your House from Georgia will be able to give you additional information on the subject, if it is desired.
            The present law, which denies to the Northern District the benefit of a Circuit Judge, is that of August 11, 1848. See Sec. 8, 9 U.S. Stats. 281.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
