            James W. Locke, Esq.
            Clerk U. S. Court, Key West, Fla.
            Sir:
            By direction of the Attorney General, ad interim, I return herewith the copy of the judgment, &amp;c. in the case of the United States, vs. The Schooners John Williams &amp; Cargo, transmitted in your letter of the 18th inst.
            The copy contains not a single date, and is therefore perfectly useless. You are requested to make a new certificate, with the dates of the entries referred to, and forward it at your earliest convenience.
            Very respectfully yours,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
