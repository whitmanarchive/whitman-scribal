            Hon. H. H. Wells
            U. S. Attorney,
            Richmond, Va.
            Sir:
            I have received from the Secretary of the Treasury a letter to him from Ira Ayer, Jr. Special Agent of the Treasury Department, recommending that a nolle prosequi be entered in the case of Patrick McDonough, indicted at the last term of the District Court at Norfolk for concealing and facilitating the transportation of smuggled goods.
            Mr. Ayer asserts that the prosecution has been brought about by interested parties, who desire to weaken the force of the prosecution for smuggling against William H. Lyons, in which last case McDonough is a principle witness.
            I desire that you will give me your views upon the subject.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.


            Pat. McDonough 
            Va.
