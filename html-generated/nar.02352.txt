            July 13, 1869.
            Sir:
            I herewith return the patent from the State of Wisconsin, granting to the United States lot No. 2 of Sec. 17, township 30 N., range 28 E., at Bayley's Harbor, Door County, Wisconsin, together with a certificate of search from the Register of Deeds of that county, which were received at this Office under cover of your letter of the 5th ult. By this grant, the United States have, in my opinion, acquired a valid title to the land described.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
