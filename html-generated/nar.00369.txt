           December 24, 1867.
            U. S. Grant, General, U. S.A.
            Secretary of War, ad interim. 
            Sir:
            In compliance with your request of September 3d last, the District Attorney for West Virginia was instructed to appear for the United States, in the case of Brown vs Young, involving title to the Harper's Ferry property. He has since entered actively upon that duty, as counsel for the War Department. The Attorney General has received the enclosed letter from R. W. Andrews, Esq. 
                Letter Book F. p. 482.
                see p. 34 seq. 
            
            
                 
                in which he mentions the fact that there are a number of suits of ejectment, which, having been interrupted by the war, may now be revived, under the provisions of a Statute of West Virginia. The United States was the plaintiff in each of these suits,—and Mr. Andrews supposes that, as they have never been decided, the present may be a favorable moment for prosecuting them.
            As the expediency of this litigation is a matter within your province, it is thought to be proper that Mr. Andrews' suggestions be referred to your Department. His letter, accordingly, is herewith enclosed.
            I remain, yours, with the greatest respect,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            [letter enc.]
