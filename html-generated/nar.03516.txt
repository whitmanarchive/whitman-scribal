            Hon. George S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            A suit has been brought in the Supreme Court of this District by Chauncey C. Ryder vs. the Hon Columbus Delano, for an alleged failure of Mr. Delano, while Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to return, or pay for, certain spoiled or useless stamps which Mr. Ryder alleges that he delivered to Mr. Delano. I have been requested to direct the proper officer to appear in defence of Mr. Delano.
            As he was an officer of the Treasury Department at the time the alleged cause of action arose, I desire that you will inform me whether you think it proper that the defence should be undertaken by this Department.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            defence of Mr. Delano.
