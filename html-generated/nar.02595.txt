            Hon. Geo. W. French, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Yankton, Dakota.
          Sir:
            I herewith transmit an extract from an official Report of Capt. Loyd Wheaton, 20th U. S. Infantry, commanding Post at Fort Pembina, Dakota Terr., in reference to the proceedings before Commissioner Foster, against O'Neill, Curley, and others, prosecuted for violation of Neutrality Laws.
            I commend the matter to the attention of the U. S. Judiciary of Dakota.
            If the statements in relation to the conduct of the Commissioner are correct, I respectfully suggest that he is not a fit person to hold that office.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            U. S. Comm'r Foster.
                Dakota
