           March 8, 1870.
            Hon. J. D. Cox,
            Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to return herewith the adjudication of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and other papers, in the matter of certain suspended land entries, by Hiram Hayes, at the Bayfield, Wis. district, which were received here under cover of a letter from the acting Secretary of the Interior, dated Sept. 10, 1869—and also the adjudication of the Commissioner in the suspended land entry case of Merritt H. Day, in the Fort Dodge, Iowa, district, which accompanied your letter of the 16th ult. These adjudications have been approved by me.
            I am sir, with great respect,
            your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            
            certain suspended land entry cases.
