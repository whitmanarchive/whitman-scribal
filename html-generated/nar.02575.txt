            Nov. 9, 1871.
            His Excellency the Governor of New Mexico,
            Santa Fé, N. M.
            Sir:
            After due consideration of the application for pardon in the case of Wm. Knorr, who has been convicted in your Territory of "removing from postage stamps the canceling or defacing marks thereon, with intent to use the same a second time," the President has declined to grant a pardon and the Marshal of the District has been directed to proceed at once to execute the sentence, as far as that duty is incumbent on him.
              Case of Wm. Knorr
            N. M.
                Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
