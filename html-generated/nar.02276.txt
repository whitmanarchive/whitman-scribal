            George C. Bates, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Salt Lake City, U.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 11th inst. is received.
            I am troubled on account of the want of funds to carry on the Territorial prosecutions. The accounting officers of the Treasury, adhering to usage, do not feel at liberty to allow the Marshal credit for expenditures for prosecutions under Territorial law. This is perhaps inconsistent with the just deductions from the recent decision of the Judges in Utah.
            As the only thing I can do to help you, I have made the matter the subject of earnest representation to the Chairman of the Territorial Committees in Congress. And I will communicate to them the contents of your last letter.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Utah courts.
