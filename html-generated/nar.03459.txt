            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 4th instant, transmitting the papers in relation to Capt. Charles Bentzoni, 25th U.S. Infantry, for payment of Attorney's fees incurred in defending him in a suit for acts done in the line of military duty, I have the honor to say that with some misgivings as to the technical regularity of the proceedings, I will yet make the effort to do justice in the matter by directing the payment of the
            
            bill for Capt. Bentzoni's defence.
            
            accounts, out of the judiciary fund.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
