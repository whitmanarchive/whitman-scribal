            Hon. B. F. Rice,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            In response to your letter of the 17th, I have the honor herewith to transmit a digest of all the papers in this office which can possibly be imagined to come within the description of charges against Mr. Catterson, late Marshal, and Mr. Whipple, late District Attorney, for Eastern Arkansas.
            I am unable to give a positive answer to your inquiry whether charges have been made against either of those officers, not placed on file in this Department. I remember receiving extensive oral communications from gentlemen who desired that those officers should be removed, but I cannot remember that any charges were made, besides those in the papers, of which a digest is sent.
            The papers on file in this office in relation to the subject, have all been tramsitted this day to the Hon. Lyman Trumbull, Chairmain of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            charges ag't late U.S. Atty &amp; Marshal Ea. Ark.
