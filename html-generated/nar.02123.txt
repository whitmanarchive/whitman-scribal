            L. M. Ashenfelter, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Santa Fé, New Mexico.
            Sir:
            I enclose here with a copy of a letter addressed to this Department under date of the 3d  instant, by the Secretary of War, and papers therein referred to relative to the failure of A. Nelson, S. Baca, and Tilger, to execute contracts for hay, &amp;c. awarded to them by the Quartermaster's Department in New Mexico.
            I have to request that if it should appear from a careful examination of the papers, that a suit can be successfully maintained against these parties, you will at once cause the necessary legal proceedings to be instituted against them and their sureties, if any.
            I suggest that you confer with the Quartermaster at Santa Fé in regard to this matter.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            War Dep't cases defaulting contractors
