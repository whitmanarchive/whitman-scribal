            Hon. George E. Spencer,
            U.S. Senate.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 21st to Mr. Williams, with its enclosure, has been referred by him to me, it probably having been addressed to him under the impression that he is now acting as Attorney General—which is not the fact, as my resignation will not take effect until the 10th of January.
            The case of Mr. Wesson has been brought to my attention by several written and verbal communications.
            I have not yet felt at liberty to act in the matter, because it is not for me to judge whether the act for which he is indicted was done in the line of his duty as a soldier. Upon information that the War Department considers that his act was of that character, and desiresthe law officers of the Government to assume his defence, I will direct the District Attorney to appear for him.And accordingly I have referred those who have previously applied to me to the Secretary of War.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            case of Wesson
