            under precept of Judges or Commissioners, showing also the date of each arrest, and, in general terms, the offences for which the parties were arrested.

            The list should also show whether the prisoners were arrested by the military or civil authorities ; and if by the military at what time they were turned over to you.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
