            W. G. Stewart, Esq.
            Lancaster, S. C.
            Sir:
            The President has referred to me your letter to him of the 1st instant complaining
                that efforts have been made to enforce the collection of debts for slaves.
            The question is one for the Judiciary, and neither the President nor the Attorney
                General has any control over the matter. If such debts are lawful, it is presumed
                that the Courts will do their duty in collecting them; if unlawful, that they will
                do their duty in refusing the claims.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            question of debts to slaves
