            Dec. 2, 1871.
            To the President.
            Sir:
            The number of arrests in South Carolina by the military without warrant, under the Enforcement Acts, officially reported is One hundred and sixty eight, (168).
            This number does not include four cases of mistaken identity, which it is immaterial to notice. Governor Scott, in his message, puts the number at Six hundred, (600.) This probably includes the arrests under warrant.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            arrests in S. C.
