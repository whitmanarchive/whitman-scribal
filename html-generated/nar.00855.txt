            Hon. T. Lyle Dickey,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            Sir:
            Some time since, a letter was referred to you from Gen. Banks, relative to cases on appeal from the Court of Claims in the Supreme Court, known as the powder cases. Gen. Banks is desirous, on the part of the claimant, of a prompt determination of the question whether the appeal shall be prosecuted. The Attorney General will thank you, therefore, for as early a report of your views on this question as may be practicable.
            Yours very truly
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Ass't. Atty Gen'l
