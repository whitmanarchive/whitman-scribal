            John L. Delano, Esq.
            Chief Clerk,
            Department of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 22d instant, asking for certain information for the Biennial Register of 1869.
            In reply I have to inform you that by the recent Act of Congress establishing a Territorial Government for this District, the appointment of Justices of the Peace was vested in the Governor, and therefore this Department keeps no record thereof. The Levy Court was abolished by said Act, and I presume that information in regard to its late members will not now be necessary. We have no record of the appointment of the Register of Wills and Recorder of Deeds,—but such information as you may want concerning them you will find in the last Biennial Register, there having been no change made in those offices since its publication.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls, Chief Clerk
            Information for Biennial Register
