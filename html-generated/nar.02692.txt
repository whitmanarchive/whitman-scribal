            Mr. P. Preston,
            Helena, Arkansas.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter from Cairo of the 20th instant, I have to say that under the regulations of this Department I am not at liberty to give opinions on legal questions to private parties.
            I will add, however, that the information which you have received probably refers to a late decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Elias Ward versus The State of Maryland, and any competent lawyer to whom you apply will be able to tell you how far that decision affects the matter which you have in mind.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Opinion declined
