            Hon. Charles D. Drake,
            Chief Justice of the Court of Claims
            Sir:
            I enclose to you certain papers referred to me by the President, relating to Mr. Miron Winslow, of New York, who desires the appointment of Commissioner of the Court of Claims. As that appointment belongs to the Court over which you preside, I send the papers to you, with the remark that I have information that Mr. Winslow is a very estimable gentleman, and well qualified for the place.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Miron Winslow
