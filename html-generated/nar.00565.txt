            Montgomery, Ala.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 8th instant, addressed to the Attorney General, making inquiry relative to the maximum of fees, ordinary and extraordinary, which District Attorneys and Marshals may lawfully receive and retain, has been appropriately referred to the Honorable Secretary of the Interior, in whom the law has vested supervision in the premises, except as it is vested in the Court.
            Respectfully, your obedient servant,
            John M. Binckley,
            Assistant Attorney General.
