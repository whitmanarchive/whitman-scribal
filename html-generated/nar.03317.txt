            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            On the 6th day of Aug. 1871, you requested my opinion upon the question whether Henry S. Wetmore had been lawfully removed from the office of Ordinary of Chatham County, Georgia, by the Commander of the Third Military District in April, 1871, and was entitled to be restored to said office, in pursuance of the Act of Congress of July 15, 1870.
            For reasons which I have personally made known to you, the desired opinion was not given at the time.
            It appears that the request was made at the instance of Mr. Wetmore himself—and I think that the question is one rather for judicial than departmental decision. Certainly, since the termination of the military authority of the United States over Georgia, under the Reconstruction Acts, the matter can call for no administrative action on the part of the War Department.—I respectfully suggest, therefore, as an opinion upon the question can be of no practical utility, that the request for it be withdrawn.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
