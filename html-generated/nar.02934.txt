      Hon. John S. Witcher,
      House of Representatives.
      Sir:
      In reply to your letter of the 10th ult., which by some mistake was overlooked until this
        morning, I have to inform you that the papers filed in this Department in support of the
        application of General Enochs for a Territorial appointment, were returned to him at his own
        request on the 3d of May, 1869.
      Gen. Enochs' application 1869
      Very respectfully,
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
