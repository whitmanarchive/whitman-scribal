            Hon. J. M. Schofield,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I deem it proper to inform you that the following telegraphic dispatch was received yesterday afternoon at this Office, from the United States Marshal for the Southern District of Florida:
            "Application to the Judge United States District Court for writ of habeas corpus, for release of Mudd, Spangler, and Arnold has been made. Held under consideration"
            Should the court decide to issue the writ, I presume you will be duly informed of the fact by the military officers having the men in custody.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient serv't,
            J. Hubley Ashton,
            Acting Attorney General.
