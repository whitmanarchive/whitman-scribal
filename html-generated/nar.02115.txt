            C. R. Mobley, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Tampa, Fla.
            Sir:
            The Secretary of State has transmitted to me copies of certain papers which he has received from the Vice Consul General of the U. S. at Havana, Cuba, among which is the copy of an affidavit of Augustin Peralka, narrating certain facts which he alleges to have occurred to his detriment at Key West.
            You will inquire into the facts, and if you shall find any criminal statute of the United States has been violated in the premises, you will prosecute the guilty parties.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
                        
            Augustin Peralka's case
