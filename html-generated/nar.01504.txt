            M. M. Roche,
            Portsmouth, Virginia.
            In answer to your letter of the 27th inst., and your telegram of the 25th inst., I have to inform you that this Department does not see cause for recommending a pardon in the case of Thomas W. Roche,—and it is not the usage of this Department to send abroad papers that belong here on file.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            There is nothing in your letter to indicate your sex, or other address—and therefore you will excuse the abruptness of the address above.
            
            case of pardon of T. W. Roche, Va.
