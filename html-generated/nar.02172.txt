            D. T. Corbin, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Yorkville, S. C.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 13th instant, and am obliged to you for the report of the transactions in York.
            You must be governed by your own judgment, formed on the spot, after conference with the military officers, and the Marshal, upon the question of extending vigorous operations into other counties. It is certainly desirable that nothing could be done which looks like faltering.
            I do not feel quite certain that the right to be secure in one's person et cet., as that language is used in the Constitution, is violated by an irregular and unofficial seizure.
            I rather incline to the opinion that the seizures therein mentioned are those made under color of official authority. Still, I am not absolutely certain that my construction is right, and you do well to make the point.
            Upon the right to bear arms, I
            Ku Klux questions, S. C.
            
            
            
            think you are impregnable—and I think that under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments you will be able to sustain Counts for a violation of the right of free political action.
            I have written to you at Columbia in reference to a report of arrests. I presume the letter will be forwarded to you at Yorkville.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
