            Attorney General's Office,
            March 19, 1866.
            To
            H. H. Harrison, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney, Middle Dist, Tenn.
            Nashville, Tenn.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the President to say to you that he deems it important; &amp; you are therefore instructed to prosecute some few persons who have been indicted for high treason, in your court. He leaves the matter, as to which of those indicted shall be tried, to your discretion &amp; judgment, with only this qualification, the persons prosecuted must have been prominent, conspicuous, &amp; influential in getting up, sustaining &amp; prosecuting the rebellion.
            Please advise me promptly who is to be tried, when the trial will likely come off, &amp; whether you desire assistant counsel.
            I am, Sir, respectfully,
            James Speed,
            Attorney General
            March 19, 1866.
