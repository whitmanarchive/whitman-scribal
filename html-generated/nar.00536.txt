            Hon. Joseph S. Wilson,
            Commissioner Gen'l Land Office.
            Sir:
            I herewith enclose a Donation certificate in favor of Wm. C. Laughlin and wife, covering the site selected for a Brand Mint at Dalles City, Oregon, which, with other papers, has been referred here as evidence in support of the title of the proposed grantor thereof to the United States, for the opinion of the Attorney General thereon. The site, it is alleged, lies in the south half of the tract described in the certificate, for which no patent has ever been issued. I desire to know whether any valid objection exists to issuing a patent to the claimant in the certificate for said tract. Please furnish me this information, and also any other which may be in your possession touching the condition of the title to the property mentioned, and    
            
            
            
            return therewith the certificate aforesaid.
            I have the honor to be,
            Very respectfully, your obd't serv't,
            John M. Binckley
            Assistant Attorney General.
