            A. T. McReynolds, Esq.
            Grand Rapids, Mich.
            Sir:
            In reply to your letter of the 20th inst. I have to say that I sent to the Clerk of the Supreme Court for the record in the case of the steamers "Daniel Ball," appellant, vs. The United States, No.476 December T., 1868, and find that it is not yet printed. Whether I shall be able to state to the Court that it is of such public importance as to require
            record in case of steamer "Daniel Ball," vs, U. S. 
            
            
            
            to be taken up out of order, I of course cannot determine until I see and examine it. I shall be glad to do any thing that will be personally agreeable to yourself, and will of course consent that you may submit it on printed brief and argument on your side, if you desire to do so, and will send them to me. I will communicate with your father on the subject hereafter.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
