Alfred Russell, Esq.
Detroit, Mich.
Dear Sir:
I have received your letter of the 8th inst. enclosing your account for professional services in the Supreme Court of the United States in the Repentigny case.
I recognize fully the great value of your services rendered to the government in this case in the preparation of the brief, &amp; in the argument before the Supreme Court;—but in reference to the correspondence between this Office &amp; yourself, on the subject of your compensation, I had, before the receipt of your last letter, come to the conclusion that the sum of $3,500 would be a proper allowance. Having due regard to what has been the wage of this Office as to the rate of compensation allowed to counsel upon employment by this office, I feel that I am scarcely warranted in giving my official approval to your charge of $5,000.—I therefore return the account to you with the suggestion that you reduce it to the sum I have indicated, which, being done, I will promptly add my approval.
Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.
            signedHenry Stanbery.
