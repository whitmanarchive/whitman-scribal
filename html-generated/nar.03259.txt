            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I enclose a communication from Messrs. Sherwood &amp; Howland, Attorneys at Law, on the subject of the proceedings in the Eastern District of New York against the steamer "Cleopatra".
            As the matter is more appropriate to your Department than to this, I refer the papers to you.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
