            Hon. W. H. Hooper,
            House of Representatives.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 5th instant, with the enclosed draft of a bill to allow writs of error to the Supreme Court of the United States from the Supreme Courts of the Territories.
            I do not feel at liberty to express any opinion upon the merits of your proposed bill.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            certain proposed bill.
