            The Honorable,
            N. H. Swayne,
            Justice of the Supreme Court.
            Sir:
            I desire to say that I fully concur with the application of Messrs. Matthews and Perry for a hearing before you in relation to the appointment of receivers of certain Railroad Companies in Tennessee. The amounts involved are very large, and the suits are of the highest public interest and importance, and I think that if ever it is done, it is desirable that the authority of the Justice of the Supreme Court assigned to the Circuit shall be exercised.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            app. of certain receivers
