            Hon. Wm. T. Sherman,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose to you a copy of a letter from my assistant at the Court of Claims, in relation to a suit pending in that court to recover a claim against your Department. I think it would be clearly for the interests of the Government to incur the small expense suggested in the letter.— There is no fund under my control from which it can be defrayed, and I wish, therefore, to ask whether the War Department will authorize the employment of Mr. Bent, and provide for his compensation. Such a course has not been unusual in the several Departments heretofore. 
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Suit on claim ag't War Dept.
