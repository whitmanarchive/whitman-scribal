            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter to you from the U. S. Marshal for the District of Vermont, dated the 11th inst.—and of a telegram sent him by you in reply.
            I have instructed the Marshal to do all that he can to prevent any violation of the Neutrality Laws within his District, and to apprehend and hold for trial and punishment all persons who shall violate them.
            I am of opinion, however, that if any attempt is seriously made to invade Canada with a military force from Vermont, it can only be prevented by the use of military force, which the President, or such other person as he shall have

            Very respectfully,
            Your obedient servant,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
