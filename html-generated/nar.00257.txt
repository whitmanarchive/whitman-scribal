            Alfred Russell, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Detroit, Mich.
            Sir:
            A few days since I gave to the Secretary of the Interior my opinion in favor of the payment of your fee of $3,500 as special counsel in S. C. U. S. in re Repentigny.
            I have just received a letter from the Secretary that he has approved its payment, and has referred it to the 1st Auditor of the Treasury "for adjustment - payment to be made from the Judiciary fund."
            Very respectfully,
            Henry Stanberry.
