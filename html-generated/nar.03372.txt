            Alexander Johnston, Esq.
            Sir: I enclose herewith a letter from Mr. A. Stow asking the return of certain papers which he sent to this Department in December last. It appears from the records that these papers were referred to Mr. Talbot on the 9th of December last. Will you be kind enough to return them to me by your messenger on Monday morning?
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls, Chief Clerk.
            return papers
