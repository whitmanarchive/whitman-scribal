            To
            Orville Jennings, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney, Eastern Dist.
            Little Rock, Ark.
            Sir:
            I am instructed by the President to say, that when the persons against whose property proceedings are pending in the Court at Little Rock, shall present to you pardons, you are fully authorized, if in your judgment it should be done, to discontinue such proceedings, upon any terms not inconsistent with the terms of the pardon.
           This authority is to cover all cases, no matter under what Act or Acts of Congress the proceedings may have been instituted.
            I am sir, very respectfully
            your obedient servant,
            James Speed
            Attorney General.
