            Mr. H. H. Trumbs
            Frankfurt, Ky.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 26th ult. addressed to Gen. Murphy, U. S. Marshal of Kentucky, has been forwarded to Washington, and referred to this Department.
            This administration is not indifferent to such outrages as you report. Under the Civil Rights Bill, such cases can be carried before the U. S. Courts in States which do not admit the testimony of colored men; at least that has been the holding in the U. S. Courts, of Kentucky. The correctness of this holding has been denied, and the Constitutionality of the Act of Congress transferring cases of that sort to the U. S. Courts has also been denied. These questions have lately been argued before the Supreme Court of the United States
                Outrages in Kentucky 
            
                
            and are awaiting decision by that tribunal. I trust that the decision will be such as will uphold the jurisdiction of the U. S. Courts—and then we may hope that such offenders as the man who murdered your brother will be brought to justice.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
