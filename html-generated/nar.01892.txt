            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 3d ult. with papers enclosed, relating to a proposed compromise of the case of Bochrock and Frankel, arising under the Internal Revenue laws. I enclose for your information a copy of a letter dated June 2d, inst., from the Dist. Attorney of the Eastern Dist. of Penn. to this office, explaining the condition of the case.
            I doubt if the offer to pay one hundred dollars, in addition to the forfeiture of the twelve barrels of whiskey, is regarded as open by Bochrock &amp; Frankel; but if it so regarded by them, I recommend its acceptance as a compromise of the case. The papers sent with your letter are returned enclosed.
            I have the honor to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
