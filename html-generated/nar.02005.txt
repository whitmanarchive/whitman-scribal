            Hon. David Noggle,
            Chief Justice Supreme Court,
            Lewiston, Idaho.
            Sir:
            
            I have received your letter of the 3d ultimo.
            
            The construction which this office puts upon the law to which you refer, is, that there shall be no pay to a territorial officer for the year in which there is any absence, without the certificate of the President—and this certificate is given as of course when the absence was with leave of the Head of the proper Department. The proviso in the Act
                
                pay &amp; absences Territorial officers
                
                
            
            of 1851, to which you refer is not considered in force
            
            For the reasons given in your letter you have leave of absence for a time not exceeding fourteen days—to be taken either in the present month or the next.
            
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            leave of absence
