            Hon. John A. Rawlins,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst. with Enclosures, all relating to the charge of murder against Charles Watts. I enclose a copy of a letter sent by me to the U. S. Attorney for Washington Territory, instructing him in regard to the case.— I have respectfully to ask that you will issue the necessary orders to the commanding officer at San Juan island, to deliver the prisoner to the Sheriff or Marshal of Washington Territory, whenever either is ready to receive him.
            Very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
            [Enclosure.]
            Charge of murder ag't Charles Watts.
