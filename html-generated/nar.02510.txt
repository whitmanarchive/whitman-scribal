            R. S. Chew, Esq. Chief Clerk
            State Department.
            Sir:
            The Solicitor General has just handed me your note to him.
            I regret the mistake. You will please cause the Commissions
            
            Indexed in Ex. B'k
            certain commissions
            
            
            
           to be issued now, to take effect on the 16th instant. It is desirable that these commissions should be signed by the President before he leaves the city, this noon.
            Very respectfully,
            A. J. Falls,
            Chief Clerk.
