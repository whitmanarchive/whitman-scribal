            Joseph R. Bennet, Esq.
            U. S. Marshal,
            Detroit, Mich.
            Sir:
            I have addressed the District Attorney of your District on the subject of trespasses upon the Light House grounds near Monroe Harbor, and enclose to you a copy of the communication.
            If he advises that the case is one justifying summary proceedings under the law against the trespasses, you will forthwith proceed in a summary way for the protection of the government property.
            Very resp'lly,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            trespassers, Mich.
