            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a copy of dispatch No. 963, from the Vice Consul General at Havana, in relation to the illegal expulsion of Augustine Peralta from Key West, and to inform you that I have transmitted a copy of Mr. Peralta's affidavit to the U.S. Dist. Attorney for the Southern Dist. of Florida, with instructions to inquire into the facts, and, if he shall find that any criminal law of the U.S. has been violated in the premises, to prosecute the guilty parties.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            A. Peralta's case
            Fla.
