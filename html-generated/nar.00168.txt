            Dec. 4, 1866.
            To
            Hon. W. H. Seward,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have examined the letter of Gov. Holden, of North Carolina, which you have referred to this office. I find that Gov. Holden requests you to inform him whether a person who has not taken the amnesty oath prescribed in the President's Proclamation of May 29, 1865, &amp; who refuses to take that oath, is eligible to office in North Carolina. Upon such a question so presented, it does not seem to me that I have authority to give an official opinion; &amp; I find that the established usage of this Office is to the same effect. I am, therefore, compelled to decline further action upon the question, &amp; beg you to advise Gov. Holden of the ground upon which compliance with his request cannot be granted.
            I have the honor to be,
            Very respectfully,
            Henry Stanbery,
            Attorney General.
