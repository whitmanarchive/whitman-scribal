            Thomas H. Talbot, Esq.
            Assistant Attorney General.
            Sir:
            After consideration of the cases of David and Thomas Harrison, and of Stephen Watson, the subject of your letter of August 22, I do not feel at liberty to order a dismissal of the appeal. You can therefore prepare for the presentation of the appeal. If, upon further examination, I become satisfied that the case of the Government should not be presented to the Supreme Court, I will reverse this direction.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l,
            and Acting Attorney Gen'l.
            take appeal
