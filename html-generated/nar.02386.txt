            Mr. W. J. Promis,
            Belmont, Sumpter Co. Ala.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 22d instant.
            If you can refer me to any persons who know of such outrages as the Committee of Congress is 
            
            
            investigating, I will lay the names before the Committee, so that if thought proper the witnesses can be summoned. If you know of any breach of the United States laws by Ku-Klux parties or others, you will do well to acquaint the U. S. District Attorney of your District with the facts.
            In the southern District of Alabama the District Attorney is John P. Southworth, Esq. of Mobile; in the other District John A. Minnis, Esq. of Montgomery.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Ku-Klux, Ala.
