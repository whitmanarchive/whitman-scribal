            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            In answer to your letter of the 6th instant, requesting my views as to the expediency of complying with the application of James Grant, Esq. for the use
            
            J. Grant's application
            
            
            
            of certain documents, or copies of them, during the examination of witnesses at Rock Island on the 20th instant, in the cases of Case and Van Wagener, and Case &amp; Co. vs. the United States, I have the honor to say that I think that the desired papers should not be furnished to Mr. Grant, unless he can first satisfy William McMichael, Esq. Assistant Attorney General, having charge of the business in the Court of Claims, that it is proper that the papers should be furnished, and obtain Mr. McMichael's written concurrence in the application.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
