            Hon. Wm. McMichael,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            Sir:
            Mr. Johnston, of your office, sent me, a week or two ago, the proof of a brief on the motion to be made next Friday in the case of The United States vs. Hubbell, now pending in the Supreme Court.
            On examining Mr. Talbot's brief, I preferred to make one of my own, and have done so, and will send it to the branch printing office in the Treasury Building. Your messenger may therefore tell the other printing office to distribute the type, as the brief will not be printed there.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            Clement Hugh Hill,
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
            
            certain brief
