            M. D. Phillips, Esq.
            Henrietta, N. Y.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to say in reply to your letter of the 2d inst. that he can furnish from the records of this Office lists of the U. S. District Judges and Attorneys; but to do so in all cases where requests are made would entail more labor on his clerical force than he is willing to do, except for some specified object of importance.
            The U. S. Official Register contains the information you desire, and a new edition will be issued in a few days.
            Very respectfully,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Ch. Clerk.
            Information declined.
