            Hon. O. F. Strickland,
            Asso. Justice Sup. Court, Utah Terr.
            Salt Lak City.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 9th inst. relating to the powers and duties of the United States Court of Utah and its justices in the naturalization of aliens.—The questions you ask are judicial questions, and must be determined by the Court. I do not deem it proper for me to express an opinion upon them.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
