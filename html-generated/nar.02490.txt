            Sept. 27, 1871.
            Hon. Isham Reavis,
            Associate Justice
            Arizona City, A. T.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 11th instant, detailing the circumstances of your
                recent absence from your Territory, for the purpose of visiting your sick child in
                Nebraska, and asking that the Department will sanction your absence, although
                permission to be absent from your post had not previously been granted you.
            In view of the many complaints made on account of the Judges being absent from their
                Districts, and by reason of the Executive Order on this subject, the Department must
                be rigid in regard to granting such leaves to the Judicial officers in the
                Territories. 
              absence.
                368
                 
              However, I can
                appreciate the feelings of a father in wishing to visit the bedside of his sick
                child—and in consideration of the necessity of your absence on this occasion,
                and the purpose for which you left the Territory, cannot do otherwise than approve
                of your action.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
