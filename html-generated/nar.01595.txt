            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell, Esq.
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose a memorandum in relation to the case of E. C. Boudinot, et al. vs. The United States, in the Supreme Court of The United States, accompanied with her request of the counsel for the appellants, that an early consideration of it may be had.
            This Department is disposed to advance the case upon the docket of the Court unless the Treasury Department is apprised of some reason why such a course should not be taken. I would respectfully ask you to inform me whether such reason exists.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; acting Attorney General.
            in regard to advancing the case of E. C. Boudinot vs. The U. S. in Sup. Court.
