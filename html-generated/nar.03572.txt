            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, inquiring whether any thing has been received from the District Attorney for the Western District of Texas, who, on the 29th of July last was instructed to obtain information
            
            W. Texas.
            
            
            
            for the Mexican Commission—and to say, in reply, that no answer to my communication has been received from the District Attorney; and that I have this day called his attention to the subject, and have desired a prompt answer.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
