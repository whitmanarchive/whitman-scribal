            Hon. John L. Murphy,
            Asso. Justice of the Sup. Ct. of Montana Terr.
            Knoxville, Tenn.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 9th instant has been received.
            I think it very desirable that the courts should be regularly held in the Territories—and though I have no doubt that your reasons are good for delaying your departure until the first of March, yet I shall be very much gratified if you can arrive in the Territory in season to hold Court at the appointed time. I am unable to say with certainty when the Courts will be held—but have communicated to day to Mr. Maynard for your behalf all the information on that subject of which I am in possession.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            official request, &amp;c.
