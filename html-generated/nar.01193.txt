            Wall street, New York.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to say that the argument in the case of Hiram Barney, Collector, &amp;c. vs. C. F. Schmeider, et al. No. 70, will probably be heard on Thursday next, and you are expected to be ready for it when reached.
            I enclose copy of brief for the plaintiff in error.
            Very respectfully,
            M. F. Pleasants,
            Chief Clerk.
            Sup Ct. case No.70.
