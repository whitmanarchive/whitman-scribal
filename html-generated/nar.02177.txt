            J. H. Standish, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Grand Rapids, Mich.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 14th ult. enclosing the account of the firm of Standish and Ballard for professional services in the cases of the State Court of Michigan against James H. Kidd and others was duly received.
            The account has been made the subject of a communication with the Department of the Interior, by which your appearance as counsel in said cases was first authorized—and the Secretary of the Interior and myself are both of the opinion that it is extravagantly unreasonable, and altogether out of proportion to the compensation which the Government usually pays to counsel for services of that character. We do not feel authorized to pay more than $1200 for the services—and as a portion of the services was authorized by the Department of the Interior, and a portion by this Department, it has been arranged with the Department of the Interior that $800 will be paid by it, and $400 by the Department of Justice. This will, as you perceive, require two sets of vouchers.
            
            350
            charge disallowed
            Mich.
            
            
            
            If you will make out, therefore, your account against the Department of the Interior receipted in duplicate for $800, and a similar account receipted in duplicate against this Department for $400, and transmit them to this Department, prompt payment will be made.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
