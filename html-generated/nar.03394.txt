            The President.
            Sir:
            In compliance with your telegram of this morning from Bridgeport, Connecticut, I have prepared a proclamation suspending the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus in certain counties in South Carolina, and send it to you by Mr. Sherman, of this office, who will leave the city to-night, and take the first train from New York to Boston.
            In the preparation of this proclamation, I have pursued as literally as possible the language of the statutes under which it is prepared, following also the language of your proclamation of warning. You will observe that the suspension relates solely to persons arrested for violation of the Act of Congress in question. Without this qualification your proclamation might be deemed a suspension of the writ in ordinary cases arising in the State Courts, and having no relation whatever to violations of this Act.Inasmuch as the Proclamation cannot be issued before next Tuesday, the 17th instant, I have left the date blank, that it may be dated and issued on such day as you may see proper.
            Mr. Sherman will await your pleasure.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            President's Proclamation
