            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3d instant, enclosing for such action as might be deemed proper, by the Attorney General, certain papers relating to the failure of A. Nelso, S. Baca, and S. Filger, to execute contracts awarded to them by the Quartermaster's Department in New Mexico.
            In reply I have to inform you that I have caused copies of your letter, and the papers referred to, to be transmitted to the Attorney of
            defaulting contractors
            New Mexico
            
            
            
            the U.S. at Santa Fé, with instructions if in his opinion a suit can be successfully maintained against said parties, to at once institute the proper legal proceedings against them.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor Gen'l
            &amp; Acting Attorney Gen'l
