            Hon. G. W. Scofield, M. C.
            Warren, Pa.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 26th inst., and referred it to the Secretary of the Treasury, for such action as he may see fit to take. As the case ag't Jouette concerns the Department of the Treasury and the Navy, I am not inclined to issue any instructions in it without consulting those Departments.
            Very respectfully yours,
            W. A. Field,
            Assistant Attorney General.
            
            case ag't Jouette.
