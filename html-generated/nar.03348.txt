            A. B. Mullett, Esq.
            Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department.
            Sir:
            I enclose herewith three original letters, drawn from the rebel archives, in the War Department, for the purpose of being used as evidence in the Court of Claims in the case of Mervin N. Jones.
            Owing to the great importance of preserving complete such archives, and for fear of the loss of the originals, the Secretary of War requests that photographic copies thereof be taken, to be placed on the files of his Department. I have the honor, therefore to request that you will cause a half dozen photographic copies of each of the enclosed letters to be made and transmitted to me at your earliest convenience. Any expense attending the same will be promptly paid.
            In this connection I have to state that hereafter it may be necessary to have photographic copies made for similar purposes.
            Will you please inform me
            papers from rebel archives,
            photographing the same
            
            
            
            if you will have them made when called for?
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
