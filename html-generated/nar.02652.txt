            Dec. 6, 1871.
            Messrs. Lewis &amp; Fullerton,
            No. 1426 New York av.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir: Yours of the 4th instant, in
            
            
            
            
            relation to Mr. Vaughan's claim for compensation in a pardon case has been received.
            I am unable to make the statement for which you ask, because the application for pardon was not considered in this Department, but in the Bureau of Military Justice, which pertains to the War Department, the conviction having been rendered by a military commission.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            certain pardon case
