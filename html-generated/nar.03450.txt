            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir: I have the honor to enclose herewith the document suspending E. C. Camp, Esq., from the office of Attorney of the United States for the Eastern District of Tennessee, until the end of the next session of the Senate, and designating George Andrews, Esq. to perform the duties of such suspended officer in the meantime—the same having been revoked by the President.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
