            The Attorney General directs me to reply to your letter of November 30, enclosing a letter of Surgeon Sam'l Jackson, relative to a charge made against him of $119, difference of exchange, for drafts on Baring Bros. &amp; Co. in the year 1859; and to say that a search among the records &amp; papers of this office has failed to discover any correspondence or action taken by this office upon the subject named by you.
            Very respectfully
            your obd't servant
            Wm. Stewart
            Chief Clerk
            The letter of Surgeon Jackson is herewith returned.
