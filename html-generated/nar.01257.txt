            Hon. T. W. Osborn,
            United States Senate.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 11th inst., with a letter from William W. J. Kelly, to you, enclosed therewith, asking me if any change has recently been made in the practice before U. S. Commissioners, relating to the issuing warrants for the arrest of seamen deserting from vessels of Great Britain—and I have to say, in reply, that I have no knowledge of any thing beyond what is contained in the laws of the United States and the treaties with Great Britain, and that the Secretary of State is the person to whom, I think, you should make application for the information you seek.
            The letter of Mr. Kelly to you is herewith returned.
            Very respectfully,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
            Concerning arrest of foreign sailors.
