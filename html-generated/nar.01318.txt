            Hon. Henry Stanbery,
            Cincinnati, Ohio.
            My dear Sir:
            The case involving the naturalization question was reached to-day in the Supreme Court, and no counsel appearing on the other side, your letter was read to the court. As they preferred not to consider the case ex parte, they decided to postpone it until the first Tuesday of December next, and directed that your cause, involving the same question, should stand for argument at the same time. I understand that a telegram to the same effect has already been sent you.
            I hope this arrangement will prove agreeable to you—and am,
            Very truly yours,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General
            Sup. Court argument postponed
            see pp 273, 275 ante
