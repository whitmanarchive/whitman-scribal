            August 1, 1865.
            Mrs. H. J. Cowden,
            Westfield, Chautauqua, N. Y.
            Madam:
            The President has received your letter, and has requested me to send you an answer to the following purport. Your case is indeed one calling for sympathy, and possesses his. The insurgent authorities could confer no title to your husband's land in Texas,  and as soon as the courts are in operation there, you can certainly claim and get possession from whoever may be using it.
            As to the sheep wool, &amp;c. a suit against the persons who seized them will hold good. Otherwise an application to Congress           
            
            
            
            for indemnity, is the course. The President wishes me to thank you sincerely for your kind &amp; devout personal wishes.
            Very respectfully
            Your obedient servant,
J. Hubley Ashton,
Acting Att'y General.
