            Hon. J. H. Howe,
            Associate Justice
            Cheyenne, Wyoming Terr.
            Sir:
            I have deferred an answer to yours of the 24th ultimo, requesting leave of absence from
            
            
            your Territory, because I had reason to suppose that an Executive order would soon be issued upon the subject.
I suppose that a copy of that order has been received by you.—Under its provisions I do not feel at liberty to authorize the absence which you request. You have already had leave of absence for forty days since the 10th day of December last, and without a partiality that would expose you and me to animadversions, apparently just, I could not make an exception to the rule which the law prescribes, and which the President, by this order, calls to mind.
I perceive the force of the personal reasons which move you to desire a leave of absence, but I cannot yield to them without an example that would seriously impair my efforts to carry out the views of Congress and the President in this matter of absences.
Very respectfully, &amp;c,
A. T. Akerman,
Attorney General.

            declining leave of absence.
