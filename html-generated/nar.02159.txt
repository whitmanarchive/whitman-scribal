            Nov. 13, 1871,
            D. T. Corbin, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Columbia, S. C.
            Sir:
            I enclose the copy of a letter from Wm. Magill Fleming, Esq. with a postscript from L. E. Johnson, Esq. U. S. Marshal, in relation to the case of Benjamin F. Bates, of Spartanburg, S. C., who is under arrest for alleged crime against the United States.
            
            B. F. Bates' case
            S. C.
            
            
            
            If you shall be satisfied that the mitigating circumstances alleged in this letter exist, you may consent to the release of Mr. Bates on bail. You will also apply to his case the principles of the recent general instructions from this Department addressed to you at Yorkville.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
