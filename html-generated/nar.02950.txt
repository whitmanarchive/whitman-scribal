      Hon. J. A. J. Creswell
      Postmaster General.
      Sir:
      I have received from Mr. Cochran, Superintendent of mail depredations, under date of the
        10th instant, a communication referring to this office, the account of a physician in
        California for medical attendance upon a U.S. prisoner who attempted to commit suicide. It
        seems to have been sent to the Post Office Department because the prisoner was under arrest
        for violation of the post-office laws.
      Acct of certain Physician Cal.
      see Ins. B'k B. p 345.
      
      The custom, in such cases, is for the Marshal in whose custody the prisoner is at the time
        the service is rendered, to pay all reasonable charges for medical attendance, and include
        the same in his account with the Government. I shall therefore send the account of Dr.
        Curtiss to the Marshal of California for disposition in the usual way.
      Very respectfully, &amp;c.
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
