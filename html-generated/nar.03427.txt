            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, enclosing papers
            
            
            
            relative to depredations committed upon the Government property at Houlton, Maine.
            I have this day authorized and directed the U.S. Attorney for the District of Maine to take such legal steps in the prosecution of the guilty parties as may be called for by the facts in the case—and also to press the case to a trial at the earliest practicable moment.
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General
            &amp; Acting Attorney General
            
            depredations &amp;c
            Maine
