            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose herewith an account, amounting to $89.80, of H. Bisbee, Jr. the Attorney of the U.S. for the Northern District of Florida, for services and expenses in examining title to site for a Light House on Anastoris Island, Florida. This service was rendered at your request, when you referred the letter of Major Elliott to you of the 13th of May last, in which he asked that instructions be sent to the U.S. Attorney by this Department to render such legal services
            bill of H. Bisbee
            Fla.
            
            
            
            in the premises, as might be necessary, and the expense would "be borne by the special appropriation for the erection of the Light House."
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
