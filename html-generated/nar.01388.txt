            John W. McGill, Esq.
            P. O. box, 573.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 18th inst. enclosing the claim of Jabish Clement, of San Francisco, to be paid for services alleged to have been rendered in stenographically reporting the evidence in the case of The United States, vs. Ridgley Greathouse, et al.
            If the employment of Mr. Clement was authorized by the Head of any Executive Department of the Government, I will thank you to inform me when and by what Department. It is stated
                
                claim of Jabish Clement of California
              see p. 385 seq.  
            
            
                in Mr. Sharp's certificate that in November or December, 1863, he "presented to the proper Department at Washington the demand of Mr. Clement for said services," but he does not state—and it nowhere appears from your letter, or the papers accompanying it,—to which Department the claim was presented. You will please inform me when, and to what Department, the claim has been heretofore presented.
            Very respectfully
            W. A. Field,
            Acting Attorney General.
