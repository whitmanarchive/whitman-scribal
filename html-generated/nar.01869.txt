            Gaston Meslier, Esq.
            Mobile, Ala.
            Sir:
            The Secretary of War has referred to me your letter of April 7, 1871, to General Shriver, Inspector General, requesting that an indemnity bond which was forwarded to the Attorney General, relating to certain lots of land in Mobile, should be canceled, and returned to the parties.
            After careful search, no such bond has been found in this office. If you can give any further description of the paper, by names of parties, dates, or otherwise, another search will be made.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            regarding a lost indemnity bond.
