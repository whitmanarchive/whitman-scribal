            Hon. Noah Davis,

            Sir:
            The complaint in the case of the Ocean National Bank of New York, vs. the Receiver of the First National Bank of Selma, Ala., accompanying your letter of the 12th ultimo, is returned herewith as requested in your communication of the 31st.
            In as much as the conduct of such suits is by law, entrusted to the Receiver subject to the contract and supervision of the Comptroller of the Current, I do not feel at liberty to give further directions in this matter than are contained in my last letter, but will forward a copy of your communication of the 31st ultimo to the Secretary of the Treasury, with suggestion that the same be sent to the Comptroller of the Currency.            
            Very respectfully,
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            
            Ocean National Bank, N. Y.
