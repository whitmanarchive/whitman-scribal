            George Andrews, Esq.
            U. S. Attorney,
            Knoxville, Tenn.
            Sir:
            I enclose the papers relating to the horse-claim of George Hall, No 15689, which is believed to be an attempt to defraud the United States and to be one of the class of claims
           
           
            fraudulent claim, Tenn. 
            
            
            
            which you have to present under investigation.
            If you ascertain that this claim is fraudulent, you will proceed against the guilty parties.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
