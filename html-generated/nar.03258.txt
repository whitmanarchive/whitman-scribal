            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I enclose a copy of a letter from W. C. James, Esq. of Grenville, Hunt Co. Texas, asking that Lieut. W. N. Huger, 11th U.S. infantry, may be directed to appear before the District Court of Hunt Co. Texas, to testify for the defendant in a prosecution for murder.
            This prosecution is not in a U.S. Court, and I have no official connection with it, but I know Mr. James to be a respectable attorney, and it will give me pleasure for you to direct the appearance of the witness, if such direction is in accordance with the rules of the War Department.
            I also enclose a certified transcript of an affidavit filed for continuance of the cause, on account of the absence of that witness.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
