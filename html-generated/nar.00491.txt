            J. V.N. Lothrop, Esq.
            Detroit, Mich.
            Sir:
            In conformity to oral promise, I have to announce the result of the examination made by the Attorney General ad interim, of the question relating to the Detroit House of Correction, referred by the Head of the Treasury Department. He is of opinion that the said institution is not a "manufactory," in the sense of the Revenue Laws.
            Respectfully,
            John M. Binckley
            Assistant Attorney Gen'l.
