            Major Gen. E. O.C. Ord,
            Head Quarters Dept. of California
            San Francisco, Cal.
            Sir:
            Your letter of the 19th ult. has been received, and the papers therein enclosed have been transmitted to the Secretary of War for such consideration and action as he may deem proper.
            It is not customary for this office to act in the matter of instruction to a District Attorney without the request of the Head of some Executive Department.
            I am, sir, very respectfully,
            your obedient servant,
            Wm. M. Evarts
            Attorney General.
