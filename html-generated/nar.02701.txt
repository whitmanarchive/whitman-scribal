            Mrs. Priscilla A. Ferguson,
            Groton Bank, Groton, Conn.
            Madam:
            The President has referred to me your letter to him of the 6th instant, on the subject of the Fox will.
            However strongly his sympathies may be moved by the facts, which you state, it would be inconsistent with his duty to abandon any interest which the Government has in the Fox estate.
            The questions involved in the litigation about that estate are important, and it is desirable to have them definitely decided; and therefore it is the duty of the officers of the Government to see that they are properly presented to the Courts.
            Should the Courts decide against the Government, I am sure that the President will feel no regret that the meritorious heirs whom you describe get his estate. If the decision should be in favor of the Government, Congress alone has power to relinquish the property to the family.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            the Fox estate case,
            Conn.
