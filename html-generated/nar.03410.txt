            Sir:
            Under date 3d instant, papers relating to the pension of Sarah J. Hickey, claiming to be the widow of Lafayette Hickey, who, it was represented, served in Capt.

These papers are of importance to this Department in connection with prosecutions about to be instituted under its direction, and I respectfully request that originals, or certified copies, of all papers relating to this case, may, at the earliest convenient moment, be furnished to this Department.
            Very respectfully,

            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
            
            certain papers requested.
