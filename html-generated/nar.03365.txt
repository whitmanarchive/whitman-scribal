            Hon. W. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to this Department under date of the 21st ultimo, by J. R. Beckwith, Esq. Attorney of the U.S. for the Dist. of Louisiana, relative to the prosecution of James Hill andShepherd.
            This Department does not concur in the views of the District Attorney in regard to this case. I am of the opinion that these parties could be convicted under the 30th
            case of Hill &amp; Shepherd
            La.
            
            
            
            section of the Act of March 7, 1867, (14 Stats. 484,) and the District Attorney has been so informed.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,
            &amp; Acting Attorney General.
