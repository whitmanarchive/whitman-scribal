            Mr. T. E. Chambliss,
            Church Road,
            Dinwiddie Co. Va.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 9th instant. If the parties to whom you refer have violated any law of the United States—which your account leads me to suppose may be the case—you should apply to the District Attorney for Virginia, Hon. H. H. Wells, of Richmond, who will take charge of the prosecution, should he deem it proper to institute one.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            Case in Va.
