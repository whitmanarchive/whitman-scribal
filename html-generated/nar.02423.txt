            V. S. Lusk, Esq.
            Raleigh, N. C.
            Sir:
            Having learned from Senator Pool that you deem it important that the testimony before the Commissioners in the Ku Klux cases should be taken down, you are at liberty in your discretion, to employ a suitable person for that purpose, taking care that the amount of expense does not exceed $500 in all. This limitation is made necessary by the restricted appropriations for the service of this Department—and it is only on account of the extraordinary importance of the cases that I feel at liberty to allow it at all. You will send to this office copies of the testimony so taken down.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General
            Ku Klux trials examinations &amp;c N. C.
            record testimony
