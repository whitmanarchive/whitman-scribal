            E. Wright Newman, Esq.
            No. 8½ Pearl street, Baltimore, Md.
            Sir:
            In answer to yours of the 13th instant, I inform you that there is no special mode for application for a District Attorneyship. I suggest that if you desire the District Attorneyship of Utah, you address to this office a written application, accompanied with such testimonials as you can obtain of your moral, political, and professional qualifications. It is desirable that such testimonials should come from well-known persons who are in political sympathy with this administration.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            letter answered.
