      Hon. Hamilton Fish,
      Secretary of State.
      Sir:
      In answer to yours of the 23d instant, making inquiries in the case against William Barry,
        charged with the murder of Capt. Spear, in Dakota Territory, I have the honor to transmit to
        you a copy of a letter from Warren Cowles, Esq. U.S. Attorney for that Territory, dated
        December 10, 1870.
      Case of Wm. Barry.
      see Ins. B'k B. p. 343
      
      Having been absent at the time of your correspondence on this subject with this Department
        in October last, I did not know that you took an interest in the matter; otherwise, I should
        have transmitted to you a copy of Mr. Cowles's letter, as soon as it was received.
      If you wish a report of the evidence and charge of the court, I will call upon the
        District Attorney to furnish them.
      Very respectfully, &amp;c.
      A. T. Akerman,
      Attorney General.
