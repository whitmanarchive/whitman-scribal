            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I herewith transmit an account which L. D. Latimer, Esq. U.S. Attorney for California, has presented to this Department, for services as special counsel for the defendant in the case of W. F. Russell vs. Timothy G. Phelps, in the U.S. Circuit Court for California, for Two hundred and fifty dollars. I also transmit the copy of
            
            Bill of L. D. Latimer, Cal.
            
            
            
            a letter from Mr. Banfield, Solicitor of the Treasury, to whom the account was referred by me. It is the opinion of Mr. Banfield that the account should be paid out of the fund appropriated for the expenses of the customs revenue,—and, as this fund is under your control, I transmit the account for your action.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
