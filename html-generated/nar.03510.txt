            Hon. Wm. H. Hooper,
            H. of R.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            In a conversation a few days ago, I referred to the possibility of obtaining a decision of the Supreme Court on the question of the legality of the juries in Utah, by bringing up a criminal case from the Supreme Court of the Territory, by writ of error, to the Supreme Court of the United States.
            Without having examined the question, I was led to this error by an attempt, the fate of which is, as yet, undetermined, to obtain a review of the decision of a Territorial Supreme Court by the Supreme Court of the United
            
            
            
            
            States. Upon examining the question, I do not find that the Statutes authorize such a proceeding.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
