            Hon. B. R. Cowen,
            Acting Secretary of the Interior.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 8th instant, requesting that the District Attorney of Minnesota be directed to prosecute any persons who may be found trespassing upon the Mille Sac Reservation—and have the honor to inform you that the Dist. Attorney of Minnesota has been directed to prosecute accordingly.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            prosecute in Minn.
