            M. Richard Levison, Esq.
            No. 15, Avenue A.
           New York.
            Dear Sir:
            I am in receipt of your letter of the 17th inst.
            The case of Rosenberg was argued a week ago in the Supreme Court. I regret that your suggestion was not made earlier, as I would have been glad to further your wishes in respect to that case. The point, in the estimation of the Court, evidently is very narrow one. I do not think that they were much impressed by the historical view of the subject
