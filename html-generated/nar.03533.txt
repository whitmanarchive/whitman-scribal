            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 12th isntant enclosing
            
            
            
            
            
            the letters of Major Poe, of the Light House Engineers, and of Peter Brown, Light House Keeper at Saginaw in relation to trespasses upon the riparian rights of the United States, at that station.
            I have instructed the District Attorney and Marshal of the Eastern District of Michigan to proceed against the offending parties civilly and criminally, and also in a summary way if the facts shall be ascertained to warrant such proceedings.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            trespasses
            Mich.
