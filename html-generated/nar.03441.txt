            Hon. Geo. S. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to hand you herewith a copy of a letter dated the 31st ultimo, from the Hon. Noah Davis, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
            Mr. Davis has been instructed by this Department to resist any attempt to bring the United States into a State Court as a party litigant by a process served on the District Attorney. But in view of the provisions of Sections 50 and 60 of the Act of June 3, 1864, I do not feel at liberty to give further directions to the District Attorney touching the course to be pursued in the matter referred to in his letter.
            Very resp'lly
            B. H. Bristow, 
            Solicitor Gen'l, 
            &amp; Act'g Att'y Gen'l
