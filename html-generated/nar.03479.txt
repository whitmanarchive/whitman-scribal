            Hon. Hamilton Fish,
            Secretary of State.
            Sir:
            I have the honor herewith to transmit the copy of a letter from Noah Davis, Esq. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in relation to the cases of Ryan and Jordan, who have been prosecuted in that District of violations of the Neutrality Laws. I also enclose the draft of an intended letter of instructions to Mr. Davis upon the subject, and will thank you for any observations or suggestions in reference to the matter.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            letter, &amp;c.
