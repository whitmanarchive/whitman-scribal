            <ab>Dec. 15, 1871.</ab>
            <ab>Richard Crowley, Esq.</ab>
            <ab>U. S. Attorney,</ab>
            <ab>Lockport, N. Y.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>The War Department has returned the account of Wm Hildreth for $96.90, for pay and expense in the investigation of the matter of Edward S. Rowland for horse-claim, with the statement that there is an appropriation under the control of that Department out of which it would be proper to pay this account.</ab>
            <ab>Although you were informed in my letter of the 23rd of November last that I did not intend to authorize you to subject the Government to expense in the inquiry directed in my letter of August 30th last, I feel bound under the peculiar facts of the case, and the probable good faith of Mr. Hildreth's services, to make an effort to compensate him reasonably.</ab>
            <ab>There is an appropriation for the detection of crimes which covers such expenditures when authorized, or recognized&#8212;but unfortunately the present appropriation is nearly or
           
           
            <note type="authorial" place="left">Wm. Hildreth's $96.90.</note>

            quite exhausted. But it is possible that Congress may add to it in a deficiency bill,&#8212;and therefore I return the account to Mr. Hildreth in order that it may be made out against this Department, and carefully examined and approved by you, and receipted by him.</ab>
            <ab>If it would appear reasonable I would feel disposed to pay it, if any fund appropriated for such objects should be in hand.</ab>
            <ab>I must say that the account now presented seems very extravagant.</ab>
            <ab>Very respectfully,</ab>
            <ab>A. T. Akerman,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
