            <ab>I have written to Mr. Carroll at Rome, New York, who has interceded in behalf of said Linkfield, and has asked that the case be dismissed, that Linkfield will be required to appear and answer to the indictment in his case when called in its regular turn at the December term of the Court.</ab>
