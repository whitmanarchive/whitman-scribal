            <ab>Oct. 24, 1871.</ab>
            <ab>Hon. W. W. Belknap,</ab>
            <ab>Secretary of War.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>I have the honor to advise you that your confidential communication of September 18th, addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury, relating to the alleged frauds practised on the Government in the matter of Capt. Bealy's Company of Independent Scouts, was referred to this Department by the Secretary of the Treasury on the 19th ultimo. As soon as received, I employed special counsel to visit Fentress county, Tennessee, for the purpose of preparing the necessary papers for a prosecution against the parties supposed to be guilty of these frauds. The Report of the special counsel has been received, and I deem the evidence furnished by him, in connection with that accompanying the Report of Lieut. Clapp, abundantly sufficient to justify the prosecution and secure the conviction of several of the parties named in the Lieutenant's Report to Gen. Halleck. I have referred the papers to the Attorney of the United States for this District, with directions to proceed at once against the parties.</ab>
            <ab>I take the liberty to add that the Special Counsel to whom this matter was entrusted was accompanied on his trip to Fentress county, Tenn., by Lieut. Clapp, and that
            <note type="authorial" place="left" rend="none">Stokes &amp; Powell fraud.</note>

            in his Report, he takes occasion to speak in the highest terms of the intelligence, efficiency and gentlemanly deportment of that officer.</ab>
            <ab>Very respectfully, &amp;c</ab>
            <ab>B. H. Bristow, Solicitor General,</ab>
            <ab>&amp; Acting Attorney General</ab>
