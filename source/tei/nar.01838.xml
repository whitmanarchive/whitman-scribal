      <ab>April 24, 1871.</ab>
      <ab>Hon. J. R. Lewis,</ab>
      <ab>Bois&#233; City, Idaho Terr.</ab>
      <ab>Sir:</ab>
      <ab>I have promised your friend, Gen. Chipman that I would explain to you how you came to be
        superseded in office by Judge Hollister. There was no complaint of you, and I had no reason
        to suppose that you were not serving well in your office.</ab>
      <ab>A letter was received here in due course of mail, postmarked "Bois&#233; City," tendering
        your resignation. A copy of this letter, I understand, has been sent to you. There was no
        circumstance to induce the slightest suspicion of a forgery. Supposing the resignation to be
        genuine, it was made known to the President, and he nominated Mr. Hollister. The forgery was
        not ascertained until Mr. Hollister had been commissioned, had closed up his business in
        Illinois, and was on his way to your Territory.</ab>
      <ab>I regret that you have been thus wronged by some unprincipled person.</ab>
      <ab>Very respectfully,</ab>
      <ab>A. T. Akerman,</ab>
      <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
