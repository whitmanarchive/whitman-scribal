           <ab>Hon. J. B. McKean, Chief Justice</ab>
           <ab>Salt Lake City, Utah Terr.</ab>
           <ab>Sir:</ab>
           <ab>The President has referred to me the letter to him of yourself and Mr. Justice Hawley, of February 13th, 1871, in reference to officers in Utah.</ab>
           <ab>I hoped that Congress would relieve you in the matter of funds, and made every effort to procure favorable legislation.
            <note type="authorial" place="left">officers, &amp;c. in Utah.</note> 
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="nar.01859.002.jpg" type="recto"/>
            I believe, however, that this was unsuccessful. I did not feel at liberty to appropriate the Judiciary fund to a class of Territorial expenses to which it has never been deemed applicable, and which would exhaust it before the end of the year, leaving us without means of paying the general court expenses of the country.</ab>
            <ab>I write this to assure you that if it had been in my power to construe the law so as to give you the desired relief, I should have done so with the greatest pleasure. But I feel that such a construction would in effect be an enactment, and therefore beyond my power. I trust that Congress will take action in this matter early in the next session.</ab>
            <ab>Very respectfully, &amp;c.</ab>
            <ab>A. T. Akerman,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
