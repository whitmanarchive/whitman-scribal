            <ab>Hon. Garret Davis,</ab>
            <ab>U. S. Senate.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>By the fourth section of a "Joint Resolution for the protection of the interests of the United States in the Union Pacific RR. Company, the Central Pacific RR Company, and for other purposes," passed at the session of Congress which has recently closed, the Attorney General of the U. S. is authorized and directed to make certain investigations respecting illegal acts of said companies and their officers, agents and employ&#233;s.</ab>
            <ab>As I desire to do my duty under that resolution, I wish to be informed by any person who has knowledge of any sources of information upon the subject, of all facts pertinent to the inquiry;&#8212; and being informed that the section referred to was introduced by you, I apply to you in the first place, and ask, whether you have any charges to make upon any matter to which the section relates, or can direct me to any person who makes such charges, or give me any aid or direction to guide me in the investigation proposed?</ab>
            <ab>Although the language of the section is very general, I must presume that something specific was in the mind of its author, and desire to waste no time in coming

            <ab>I have the honor to be, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.</ab>
            <ab>E. R. Hoar,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
