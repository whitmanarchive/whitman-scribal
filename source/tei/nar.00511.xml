            <ab>April 11, 1868.</ab>
            <ab>Hon. Hugh McCulloch,</ab>
            <ab>Secretary of the Treasury.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>The United States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio has addressed the Attorney General <hi rend="underline">ad</hi> <hi rend="underline">interim</hi> for the purpose of making known to him that he experiences great obstruction and embarrassment in the performance of his important official functions.</ab>
            <ab>Such a Report is not deemed inconsiderable in this office, charged, as the Attonrey General is, with a responsible supervision in the premises. Due action should be taken here for communicating to the
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="nar.00511.002.jpg" type="verso"/>
            
            District Attorney, on the responsibility of his own superior, the state of the laws and regulations applicable to his case, and for requiring him to conform his action accordingly.</ab>
            <ab>In the present case, the District Attorney complains that the Marshal, also a subordinate of the Attorney General, withholds stationery from him, and that in consequence thereof he is unable to proceed with indictments, informations, declarations, dockets, letter-books, etc., and official correspondence, without providing the necessary stationery at his private expense, which he says he is unwilling to do. As it cannot be determined whether the Marshal or the District Attorney is in error, without a knowledge of the rule governing the action of the former in the matter, and it being necessary to provide for the unobstructed administration of the laws in Northern Ohio, as elsewhere, I have to request you to furnish this office, as early as practicable, with full information of the rulings of the 1st Comptroller on the subject of stationery, &amp;c. as concerned in this case&#8212;for the better apprehension of which I enclose a copy of the letter referred to, of the District Attorney, in order that we may instruct him understandingly in the premises.</ab>
            <ab>Respectfully, your obedient serv't,</ab>
            <ab>J. M. Binckley,</ab>
            <ab>Assistant Attorney Gen'l.</ab>
