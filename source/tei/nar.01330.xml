            <ab>Henry Williams, Esq.</ab>
            <ab>Counsellor at Law,</ab>
            <ab>Savannah, Geo.</ab>
            <ab>Sir:</ab>
            <ab>Your letter of April 10th is received. I should desire to procure a portrait of Judge Berrien for this Department, if a copy of one which his family regard as a good likeness could be obtained for a reasonable sum. If the picture were here, or in any northern city, I have no doubt that I could get a copy that would be satisfactory, made for $200, or $250. How skilful artists you have in

            Savannah, and what their ideas are as to prices for work which is mere copying, I do not know, and should be glad to be informed by you, if you will do me the favor. The size of the canvas I should like to have thirty inches by twenty-five, and should prefer to get it framed here.</ab>
            <ab>I had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance with Judge Berrien twenty five years ago, and should feel a personal interest in adding his portrait to the historical collection which is so nearly complete in this office. There is no appropriation for the purpose; but within reasonable limits the procuring such a picture would be allowed under the head of furnishing the rooms. If the sum I name is not adequate, I should be obliged to you if you would inform me for what sum the work could be done.</ab>
            <ab>Very respectfully,</ab>
            <ab>E. R. Hoar,</ab>
            <ab>Attorney General.</ab>
